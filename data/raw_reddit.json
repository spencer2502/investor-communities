    "text": "Since many of you askd me about my trades, here they are\nFirst of all I want to say really thanks for all the kind words and advices all of you gave me yesterday. I really appreciate it and it means alot and really helped me think deep into my situation, and to make better decisions making forward. To clearify, I am 21M and i make like 7k per month from myain job and side gigs. I started trading back in 2022 and at start i was a little profitable for a while, but later i blowed it all on meme stocks because i was new and didn\u2019t know what I was doing. Then I quit and stopped trading for a couple of years. This year I came back and got into options and lost everything again.\n\nCuz i was mad and wanted revenge on the market i did bold stupid stuff. I got promo email from Amex about personal loans for like 6% apr and i thought \u201cok this time I will win for sure.\u201d Took it, but unluckly I lost all of it in 1 day on Tesla puts. After that i was angry more and disapointed but I told myself now I am experienced and got my lesson. So last month I took another loan 20k and in a couple of weeks, I turned that into 42k. But again I went off the tracks, forgot my rules, over traded, played dumb and lost my last $10k on $MU calls and all my stupor borrowed money was gone again.\n\nNow I swear i will take no more loans. I will just work hard and pay them fast. I make decent money if I don\u2019t waste it. No more trading (gambling). Only maybe investing. Psychology is most important part in trading and I broke my own rules so many times. Like if you just stick to rules (10% position, stoploss, never risk more than 1%) it almost imposible to lose. Long term > short term. In stocks market the ones who get rich are the ones who buy a stock if they really know the business and the. sit on their ass for a long time and don\u2019t do nothing.\n\nThanks again everyone!\n",

Should I get out now and eat the 16 bucks so you think it will keep dropping or will it come back up in the future? I guess the only thing to do is hold until it comes back up right?\n\nAlso, can you explain your screenshot and what you did?   I don't get it. Did you buy an option(s) to short oklo so if it dropped in value you got paid? As you can tell I'm an extreme noob and just trying to learn more, I am staying away from options because I know they can be risky/multiply losses but curious how this worked for you."

        "text": "He bought 10 puts at the $135 strike, expiring tomorrow. A put is an options contact that gives you the right to sell 100 shares per contract at the predetermined strike price. When OP bought these, OKLO was significantly above $135 and hence he was able to buy these contracts for a lower price as if OKLO stayed above $135, then these would expire worthless tomorrow, as why would you want to sell at $135 if OKLO was worth more than $135?\n\nHowever, OKLO dropped massively in price. So now, these puts have value. Why? Because whoever owns them, can sell 100 shares per contract, at $135 each, as opposed to the current price of $111. But, instead of exercising his right to sell 100 shares per contract at $135, it's better to just sell the puts themselves to someone else. This is because the value of an option is based on intrinsic and extrinsic value.\n\nIn this case, intrinsic value would be 135-111 or $24 x 100 shares per contract = $2,400 per contract. Extrinsic value is determined by a bunch of different factors, and increases the value of the contract even more.\n\nTLDR:\n\nHe bought puts for cheap because they expired tomorrow and OKLO was significantly above the strike price.\n\nHe sold the puts for way more money because OKLO fell massively in price."

Even if their earnings suck now, if they have a lot of cash (ie book value) to lend, they have the potential to earn more profit later.\n\nJPM's price to book ratio is 2.5x right now, which is just stupid and makes no sense. Why would you pay $100 for a claim on $40 of JPM's cash?\n\nWith that being said, the entire stock market's valuation right now is unjustifiable, so JP Morgan's just shooting par for the course.\n\nI agree that OP's post is useless trash."

Bro do not confuse the swings for the loss otherwise your fight or flight reflexive response will fuck your decision making.\n\nMeditate, pray to Jesus, take mind altering hallucinogens, but you need to leave your pain behind to achieve $2M then $5M then more.

    "text": "This stock is NEXT - DD\nWinter is coming\u2026 and I think this one is NEXT, positions last pic\n\nI know this position is risky, I might roll but this is why I\u2019m here:\n\nThe idea is simple: insiders are loading up right as the company locks in real LNG growth and heads into winter. In the last week directors filed multiple open-market buys: William Vrattos purchased 100,000 shares at a weighted average $6.864, Edward Andrew Scoggins Jr. bought 15,000 shares around $6.46, and a separate Form 4 shows director Jason Dillow\u2019s purchase disclosed on Sept 18\u201319. These are actual \u201cP\u201d code buys, not grants, and total seven figures of fresh skin in the game.\n\nWhy now matters. On Sept 9 NextDecade reached positive FID and financial close on Rio Grande LNG Train 4, and management guided that Train 5\u2019s FID is expected before Nov 15 after recently signing a 1.5 MTPA, 20 year SPA with EQT for Train 5 volumes. Winter gas demand historically tightens the LNG tape, and sector prints like Sempra\u2019s Port Arthur Phase 2 FID this week underscore that U.S. LNG build-out is still accelerating into year end.\n\nThe setup is that real project de-risking plus visible commercial deals plus unusually large insider buying can force a rerate from distressed expectations. With shares around the mid-$7s today, the near-term upside case is straightforward: Train 5 financing headlines or additional SPAs into winter could be the next leg while insider conviction anchors the floor. Size it like a volatile mid-cap LNG developer and respect headline risk, but the combination of fresh director money, new FIDs, and contracted volumes is exactly the kind of catalyst stack that can keep propelling this higher.",

The assumption it\u2019ll pump through the winter is wrong, because they aren\u2019t actually selling gas and won\u2019t be for a while longer. \n\nRealistic outlook is $10 by mid year 2026, and maybe all time highs by fall if they\u2019re delivering and on track.

    "text": "Is Gold Overbought Or Is There Still More Upside Left? Here's Our\nSimple Technical Analysis and Thoughts.\nGold is now at $3760ish at the time of this post and holding, but is the momentum going to continue, or will we see a pause in the price movement upwards? Having been a Precious Metals Analyst since 2005, here are my thoughts...\n\nI think this recent bull market in gold started once it cleared $2100 and broke out to the upside, which happened in March of 2024, mostly from Central Bank buying and investor demand. Since then, it's been on a gradual ascent upwards with some pauses and consolidations before making the next leg higher. At the beginning of this year, the US started bringing lots of gold from London (LBMA) and shipping it to the US, let's say at a price of about $2800-$3000. This is something I haven't seen in 20 years, so I think that puts a floor on the price of Gold at $3000, I don't think we will ever see gold under $3000 ever again, unless we get a MAJOR BlackSwan event and total all markets liquidation, and even then, that $3000 price of gold could hold as the floor.\n\nSo, currently at $3750, can gold continue higher to $4000? Yes, I think so. The rate drop cycle that has started in the US is one of the factors that caused gold to break out of the $3300-$3400 consolidation price range this summer. If we get more interest rate drops, I think Gold goes to $4000, based on this alone, but how much further it goes beyond that is yet to be seen. I would be happy with $4000 on gold in the next few months, or maybe into early next year.\n\nThere is a seasonality to gold price movements, but since the beginning of 2024, it hasn't followed the normal patterns, and I think that's because this new bull market started then, and probably has many more years ahead of us. But once the interest rate drop cycle ends, gold will have peaked out and may retrace back to major uptrend support lines, and consolidate for the next major move, up or down.\n\nThese are just some of my initial thoughts, and I will continue to pop in on this REDDIT once and awhile to share more thoughts and updates if people here are interested.

I would simply buy more of everything. The USD dilution and the loss of US trustworthiness (government credit as well as the economy as a whole) is the game we're playing here.

Happened with GOOGL being the most memorable one, quickly shot up 5% after.\n\nBoth of our orders were always <$5k so our orders were not too large to be filled, or tranched out.

I've tried to inverse myself, reverse myself, blindly choose, guess and still come up short every time lol. And I do some research I'm just not good at the research. Let's take symbiotic for example. I was in that balls deep and I'll be damned the day that I sold it all for a huge loss it skyrocketed. Story of My Life!!!!! And I held it for quite a while."

The main point of the post was how i thought i was fucked, doubled down at the right time and hit a lucky play.

You keep enough cash/margin on hand to buy at those prices. Once the stock nears the strike, you buy the shares, if it moves below, you sell them. More specifically you buy 100 shares times the delta of each call, so maybe something like 30, 20, 10. That\u2018s if you wanna delta hedge perfectly, Im fine with having a little exposure either way to limit transaction costs, so I just buy 100. \n\nThis strategy has a fair bit of tail risk, if it swings between 9.90 and 10.10 all the time you might continously sell low and buy high, adapt the strategy for the current situation. \n\nOption premium for memestocks is super high, though, and you don\u2018t have mich exposure to either the down or upside. If you want upside exposure, just buy calls or shares, but that has other risks of course."

Basically this is a company specializing in next-generation power semiconductors, including gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) technologies. These are used in high-growth areas like AI data centers, electric vehicles (EVs), mobile charging, and renewable energy.\n\n\u2022  NVTS eyeing revival through NVIDIA AI synergies\u2014volume\u2019s solid, but P/E flags caution. Buybacks could turbocharge if fundamentals align; divested $100M+ last year signals pivot potential.\n\n\u2022  Risk-reward tightening.. Upside from scale-ups and partnerships; downside on costs/delays.\n\n\u2022  Pre-market buzz tied to EV/AI tailwinds\u2014partnership expansions and earnings guidance in focus.\n\n\u2022  Shares breaking 50-day MA on volume\u2014technical setup for extension if momentum holds.\n\n\u2022  Despite revenue dip, EV/semi growth narrative intact\u2014optimism hinges on delivery.\n\nNot financial advice, DYOR, but if AI infrastructure bottlenecks persist (hello, NVIDIA Blackwell), NVTS could be the under-the-radar winner. At the current price, I\u2019d say the room to run is to $16 after $9 breaks. We saw this on APLD. This narrative is the play.\n\nQ3 earnings Nov 3 could spotlight AI progress; ECCE and WiPDA conferences in Oct/Nov for tech showcases; CES 2026 prep might drop EV bombshells via VREMT. Recent manufacturing ramps and CEO shakeup already juiced the stock 40% on news. I\u2019m in for 700 shares already. When I hit 10K it\u2019ll be a YOLO. \n\nGood luck to all \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffb",

        "text": "Here are the bullish catalysts coming up with estimated dates so you get an idea of when this could run:\n\nIEEE Energy Conversion Congress & Expo (ECCE 2025): October 19\u201323, 2025, in Philadelphia, PA. This conference could feature NVTS showcasing advancements in power conversion tech, potentially leading to new partnerships or visibility in energy sectors\n\nQ3 2025 Earnings Report: November 3, 2025. Investors anticipate updates on gross margins, AI data center design wins (e.g., NVIDIA integrations), EV progress, and forward guidance, which could trigger a rally if results exceed expectations. \ufffc \ufffc \n\ufffc\nIEEE Workshop on Wide Bandgap Power Devices & Applications (WiPDA 2025): November 10\u201312, 2025, in Fayetteville, AR. As a forum for GaN/SiC innovations, NVTS participation may highlight product demos or collaborations, boosting credibility in high-power applications. \ufffc \ufffc\n\nConsumer Electronics Show (CES 2026): January 6\u20139, 2026, in Las Vegas, NV. Prep announcements could emerge in late 2025; expect potential reveals on EV charging tech via partnerships like VREMT Energy, capitalizing on consumer and renewable trends. \ufffc \ufffc\n\nOngoing NVIDIA Partnership Expansions: No fixed date, but Q4 2025/Q1 2026 updates possible via earnings or events. The May 2025 deal for 800V HVDC systems in AI data centers remains a core driver, with potential for scaled production or new deals amid NVIDIA\u2019s growth. \ufffc \ufffc \ufffc\n\nManufacturing and Capacity Ramps: Q4 2025 onward. Recent expansions and a $2.4B pipeline under new CEO Chris Allexandre could yield efficiency gains and revenue uplift, especially in AI and EVs. \ufffc \ufffc\n\nPotential Stock Buybacks or Insider Actions: H2 2025/Q1 2026. Following $100M+ divestitures and director buys (e.g., $164M in August 2025), buybacks could signal confidence and support share price amid positive analyst ratings."

This is a supply chain issue and a need to diversify. Intel can produce ARM chips now, and at scale in a couple years. \n\nTariffs, cost, earthquake, China invasion means if you just use TSMC, you can get absolutely fucked possibly."

It is a stock so based of elons ego and all this believers it will take a mountain of haters of his to move this thing down especially that short stent of not being named the richest man in the world. That was probably a big impact on his ego and he doesn\u2019t strike me as someone who won\u2019t try and prove a point. I could see Tesla being $480-490 by November before I could see the $390 because this stock isn\u2019t valued off what most fundemtal company\u2019s stock price is valued at. Tesla is basically grandfather of all meme stocks."

Someone swept a ton of INTC OTM calls today. The Apple News came a few hours later. Something is brewing. \n\n2). Someone is accumulating SKYT due to possible govt investment. \n\n3). Big announcement may be forthcoming in the drone space. RCAT UMAC and ONDS being accumulated. \n\n4). Rare earths still looking hot. Consider whoever hasn\u2019t done a deal yet with the govt. I have IDR and PPTA. I sold my USAR calls for like 75% gain. \n\n5). Total spec. Someone might be sniffing around ALT. This is on the heels of MTSR.  Could be a smaller up front cash buy with lot of CRV behind it. \n\n6). Crypto has fallen out of  favor but someone is going after the treasuries and IBIT. \n\nThank you for your attention to this post. (Edited due to auto correct)"

    "text": "$GAP - Yolo\nNFA, DYOR.\n\nA few people posted DD on this. I didn't do it myself - credit goes to these guys\n\nI read this DD (primary one): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nkow7c/gapping\\_up/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nkow7c/gapping_up/)\n\nTLDR of the DD: Super successful ad campaign (similar to how AEO used sydney sweeney) - but GAPs is looking much more successful. IE: Youtube ads have 3x the number of views in a shorter period of time compared to the sweeney ads & GAPs ads have also been insanely successful on tik tok - generating hundreds of millions of impressions. They went totally viral with the younger generation, with many people reposting videos / replicating the dances. Inventory was sold out across the board everywhere the original DD guy looked when the DD was posted (6 days ago)\n\n\\---\n\nAs well as this one (secondary one): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n8annm/american\\_eagles\\_earnings\\_blowout\\_is\\_bullish\\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n8annm/american_eagles_earnings_blowout_is_bullish_for/)\n\nTLDR of the DD: Similar catalyst for GAP as AEO.\n\n\\---\n\nThis only came to my attention as 2 guys in my dm's mentioned it to me & I've heard of GAP before (founded in the 1960s) so took a look. I did some very high level due diligence on, they might be right (but we won't know for months)\n\nMy DD looked at a few things. Price: It's currently trading lower than when both those DD's were posted (it's on a 3 week dip). They were all bullish (ie: good sentiment) -- I can't evaluate this one well tho due to small sample size. Chatted with a few people about it in my dm's, overall unsure how this one plays. Seems everyone had the same thesis tho. I bought these calls this morning after doing \\~30 minutes of my own DD. It looks like it's been consolidating for months. The DD I read looks real (ie: those posts didn't look to be bots to me). It doesn't look to have bots pumping it either. I missed AEO + impact of social media (Sweeney really did carry them) so I checked google trends. Yes - the trends / searches & this one actually did jump on this ad campaign, similar to how AEO did. Compounded with the school season timing, this could do well. It has already run a bit in the last few months -- so things could also be priced in. We won't know until ER's tho -- which is in November. I also am aware not near as many people here are aware of the ad campaign (ie: I wasn't). I validated it was real myself tho. I didn't see too many people talking about it here / in the daily / etc - I only became aware as some guys in my dm's dropped me the dd and asked for thoughts. One of the times my play comes thru dm's / other places than the daily. Just like things like $SNAP tho - just because you think it's dead, doesn't mean it is. See the 1st linked DD for tik tok impressions - it's over 100 million views on just one video. Their youtube ad has over 3x the number of impressions as the AEO ad did.\n\nI bought 4 months of time. I picked these strikes and expirations for risk management (sufficient time for the next ER's + a little buffer room). If the thesis is true, it'll shoot past 25. If false - probably sideways (and I eat theta decay). As with all my other plays - 4 months of time doesn't imply I'll be holding for 4 months.\n\nCurrent P/E is 9.8, and IV is super low so calls are cheap imo. They have a solid dividend too + been around long enough that they're not going anywhere so shares are also an alright bet imo. Payoff of these calls is \\~5:1 if they hit the PT's defined in the DD post, and downside is \\~50% loss assuming they decay and we just go sideways. IE: Positive EV with an expected \\~2.5:1 payoff. Shares may have a \\~50% upside, ie: \\~1.5:1 payoff. Since not many people have been discussing this one - I haven't been able to quantify risks well. I bought calls due to higher EV & the nature of my high risk investing. I'm either early or wrong, only time will tell.\n\nGoodluck chat.",

His numbers suggest the exposure of this one may be far greater than people are giving it credit for (they're targeting teens / the younger audience with the ads - who are into this type on music, ads, the girl group, etc).\n\nThey go shopping, they wanna look like their favorite star. 100m views on a single tik tok video. I youtubed the ad - it has over 30 million views too. That's people who are \\*going out of their way\\* to watch an ad on youtube. Real impressions must be much higher (how much? IDK). Ad views went from 50-100k to millions from this (see the DD post). That's not negligible imo. We won't know until we see the numbers tho. This is basically a super early ER's buying I guess\n\n\\---\n\nFor comparison, AEO's sydney sweeneys youtube video only got 9.2million views. GAP's getting over 3x more exposure here. Teenagers are replicating the dance on tiktok. That's gotta be bullish"

If people agree re: the ads / trends / etc - it's probably a good hold thru till earnings (and may run up to it). Which - is why I bought today (it's early, yah, I know). If people disagree, it'll probably just go sideways or down until then - which is when we see the real results. A lot depends on feedback + what I see over the next few weeks.

I only made like 5% as the 30% dip on my options spooked me - so I papered out the bounce as I said I would (5% profit in 2 weeks still isn't bad). If you bought the dip you'd have basically doubled up tho.\n\n\\---\n\nI think everyone has made money on every single one of my plays - sans OPEN (unless you held to $0 like me) and also MU (which is down like 3% in shares, so really a no-story) if you bought at the same time I did (and took profits). OPEN isn't a fair playing field tho -- with the news that jane is in it I'd stay even further further away. Look what they did in India.\n\n\\---\n\nThis one is more or less \"unknown\" to me & I always miss the early entrances. So figured I'd punt early this time before performing all my full risk analysis (which tends to take weeks). I liked the DD & the exact same catalyst resulted in massive beat of AEO. GAP has been doing it better (I think) though based off the DD I read. Much higher impression rates, they literally rode off the sweeney hype, and the videos are getting hundreds of millions of hits. I'm constructing the matrix / risk analysis over the next few weeks and take it from there. I have no reason to be bearish on this one (I don't see anyone saying they're dumping their bags) - it's mostly \"unknown\" right now and hard to evaluate given the lack of information.\n\nBeing said - this one is super cheap (P/E is like 9.8) and has a potential catalyst coming up (or already occurred which isn't priced in) that rocketed AEO. Very similar conditions. Doesn't mean it's right tho"

The impressions are insane.\n\nWhole sororities dancing in denim, tagging GAP & Katseye and the comments are going crazy - along with the video being shown in college marketing classes and those videos going mega-viral on tiktok too, the soft data points to a high likelihood of sell-through with this campaign.\n\nGAP is the 2nd largest segment out of the 4 brands they own, but the others have also been performing decent as of recent, with the worst one (Athleta) being their smallest. Expectations are low and with the estimates I got - a surprise sell-through on GAP Denim could move the needle enough for Q3 and set up for a good Q4 outlook, factoring in the holiday / back to school season as well. Not to mention Old Navy being their largest brand has also been doing well / is a value-oriented brand - which I think would continue it's upward momentum with the economy being so tough."

It's bullish at best, neutral at worst. It's what I primarily trade & is how I make most of my investments. This one I bought before doing that as nobody was really talking about it yet, so it wasn't really possible to quantify (other than the few guys in my dm's).\n\nI create handwaved mental matrices of \"owns stock / doesn't own stock, bearish / bullish\" and bucket people. Its a risk matrix that often gives you insights into lopsided market risks (the only thing that actually moves markets is when people buy or sell). If you end up overweight in one corner it's a fairly strong sentiment signal & indication markets might move. Why? On a potential catalyst / movement / volume increase - everyone in that bucket also starts to buy / sell (moving the market). I construct those matricies by shitposting / talking to people. Everyone plays poker / shitposts tho -- ie: nobody tells you what they are actually doing, so you gotta read a little deeper.\n\nIt also gives top & bottom signals - as if you end up with people overly bearish (who already sold) - they can't create any more sell pressure so you can ignore them. Likewise with top signals - they can't create any more buy pressure (they already bought in and want people to pump their bags). I did this on UNH when I bought - and it's why I was fairly certain we were close to the bottom (all the bears had already sold, but none of the bulls / might buys had bought yet). Super strong bottom signal. The only things that actually matter are the corners 'doesnt own but might buy' and 'owns and might sell'.\n\nI'll have a pretty good idea on GAP in a few weeks - I just wanted in because I saw the DD. I'll re-evaluate in a few weeks, GAP is on my radar now (& I'm invested)"

I suck at valuing things in absolute forms - usually just relative. It's why I don't tend to place PT's, just \"up\" or \"down\". So I trust that everyone that has already valued it / come up with their PT's has done a good job. They know all about the tariffs, etc, when formulating their targets. Alpha comes from missing information / information not factored in - which imo - they didn't factor in this ad campaign causing shelves to be emptied across the board."

Now you have to earn money for someone else to be worth $0.00, and i'm sorry it ended up that way.  \n  \nTake a break from reddit, or othe social media and the markets and really reflect on why you decided to sell your holdings early if they eventually were going to return huge gains. Try to leave the markets out of your thought process and ask yourself \"why did i make this decision? why did i go against my moral or conviction?\".   \n  \nOnce you figure that out, you should practice diligence and sticking to your convictions with things outside the markets. You have to build tolerance to risk that doesn't include your money like asking for a promotion at work, or jogging farther than you think you can or lifting heavier than you think you can at the gym. You need to practice \"for these reasons, i believe in this so i will do it\" then eventually, once you are more seasoned, apply that process to the markets, start small, and stay away from options. Stick with shares and practice more due diligence in quality companies. \n\nTHEN you will better understand your risk tolerance. If you buy options (and this should be a long, long time from now) then stick to at the monies, and dated very, very far out, even leaps. \n\nDon't feel like you can never be successful again. You lost a lot of money, but a lot of people has lost way more. Accept it as a mistake, and learn from this to try again with stronger, smarter choices. Good luck."

You think you're a genius because you're recovering, to then proceed to lose even more. I'd say, stay away and find another way to pay that debt.

Both for dealing with this situation as well as checking out whether there's some problematic behavior that you may want to work on.\n\nAfter all is said and done, you can still reevaluate whether you want to get back in, but not before learning more about risk management. You'll be an important (albeit expensive) lesson smarter than you were before.\n\nUntil then, leave this sub and don't look back. This is a bubble with rich kids flashing ridiculous bets that often are mere peanuts for them, but animate others to also gamble their life savings away and potentially enter crippling debt.\n\nIt will suck and it will suck a lot, but eventually, you'll move past this and hopefully be happier. \n\nThanks for posting this."

Bankruptcy is always an option.\n \n> Is there still a chance to recover\n \nNo, you don't know what you're doing. If you knew what you were doing, then yes there would be a chance to recover, but then you wouldn't have lost it all to begin with, or at least would understand why you lost it all and wouldn't be here asking for advice like a gambling addict."

        "text": "Moss Landing was a rare bird. Firstly, the NMC chemistry they used is quickly falling out of favor for the current flavor of LFP which will further give way to even more advanced chemistries that have cheaper and safer characteristics.\n\nThe Moss Landing ccgt peaker plant was a strong candidate for utility scale BESS co-location because when the peaker was operating power would be wildly cheap and the now full SOC batteries could operate instead of the plant the next time the gid was having a capacity event. The BESS would also perform grid ancillary services for power quality, etc.\n\nMoving forward, utilities are mainly looking to place utility-scale BESS in places with major power fluctuations due to the duck curve and/or lacking transmission. The proliferation of stand alone storage would be even greater if the batteries were not coming from Chyna and the fire community / greater community wasn't terrified of batteries. Of course, the catastrophic fires and the decommissioning of Phase 1+2 of Moss Landing isn't helping that narrative.  \n  \nHowever, the change to more advanced chemistries, industry education and domestic manufacturing arm will change this current sentiment and give the US at least a long-shot horse chance in supplying core AI infrastructure over the near term, addressing the lacking transmission crisis and combat the duck curve energy imbalances. \n\nMy only gripe with EOSE is those stupid as 16.5' containers they use. I bitched at their highest ranking brass at their booth in RE+ and said that they need to get to the industry standard. Their stupid custom enclosures make no sense and they're wasting valuable time and manufacturing capacity making their own enclosures in-house when dozens of 20' ISO containers exist."

Sold before today\u2019s pop :( and they\u2019re worth $52ish last I checked but whatever.\n\nHonestly I wish I never found this sub, I can\u2019t remember the last time I didn\u2019t file the 3k loss on my taxes. I just kept putting money into random options while scouring this sub.\n\nAt the worst point I had lost 120k of my own hard earned money. Throughout the years I had made the money back through some crazy WSB plays (GymeStonk, Iron net, etc) and within a couple days I\u2019d be back to a huge loss. \n\nI finally started looking for value plays with LEAPS and my biggest option play were these BABA calls. I bought them with a year and a half DTE with half of my account value. For some reason I wanted to hold for at least a year because I had a feeling and here we are. It was hard to stomach the ups and down constantly but it paid off.\nI think I\u2019m done for a long time, I keep checking Robinhood for my next play out of habit but I think I\u2019m going to delete the app after withdrawing it all. I put most of my BP in SGOV for now for dividends.\n\nMy advice: If you\u2019re young and naive and lurking in this sub, don\u2019t start trading options, I honestly got lucky. Maybe use a small percentage of your income for risky plays but not your entire investing budget like I did.\n\nThanks regards, I learned a lot from this sub and maybe I\u2019ll be back in a couple of years but for now, goodbye and good luck.",

You were late. That's all this is. Buy a 10 dollar otm call one month earlier and you have a 10 bagger easy.\n\nSeriously. Why the fuck do you think the stock rose 37%+ in the past month? Because they were going to meet, or fail to meet, \"expectations?\" No you fucking regard, the market expected them to beat it by a lot. For it to rise even further, they'd have to beat the new expectations even further. They didn't."

        "text": "556m shares and prepaid warrants at $1.35 go into effect after the merger with Vivek's company. at that value, market cap would be $772m, also another 556m warrants can come into play at a $1.35 cost to exercise. that would bring market cap to $1.52b at $1.35/share. Possible earliest shares can sell is 45-60 days post merger. More likely is 90-120 days post merger.\nLegacy $ASST common shareholders will only have around 16m shares after the 1 for 5 reverse split.\n\nVivek's company also gets 243m shares. to total shares will actually be 1.37b shares. at $1.35 thats $1.85b market cap. if 556 reg warrants aren't exercised at 1.35 then market cap at 1.35 would be $1.1b raising $750m. So Strive is being valued at 350m at a $1.35 share price. This is already 5\u00d7 the fair value of a company with $2b assets under management.\nIf ASST is at $7/share, market cap with 814m share is at $5.7b and strive is at $1.7b. Insanely overvalued, even if they have $750m to invest."

        "text": "# The Strategic Imperative of Neutron\n\nThe Neutron rocket represents a paradigm shift for Rocket Lab, moving it from the small-lift to the medium-lift launch market, a segment with substantially larger contract values and greater market potential.\n\n* **Payload Capacity:** Neutron is designed to lift up to 8,000 kg to LEO, and up to 1,500 kg to Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO). This enables the launch of larger constellations, space stations, and interplanetary missions.\n* **Cost Efficiency Target:** Rocket Lab aims for Neutron to be significantly more cost-effective per kilogram than Electron, utilizing a reusable first stage and a novel \"Archimedes\" engine. The target cost per launch is projected to be around $70 million, a substantial reduction compared to competitors in its payload class.\n* **Market Opportunity:** Neutron directly targets lucrative government contracts, including those from the Space Force's National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program, which are worth billions of dollars annually. It also opens doors to commercial constellation deployment and potentially space tourism.\n* **Development Status:** The development of Neutron is a critical catalyst. The first launch is targeted for late 2024 or early 2025, with significant progress reported on engine testing and stage integration at their facilities in Wallops Island, Virginia, and Stennis Space Center, Mississippi. The first landing attempt is planned for over water, followed by barge landings for increased recovery success.\n\n# Diversification into Space Systems: The \"End-to-End\" Strategy\n\nBeyond launch services, Rocket Lab has strategically expanded into the Space Systems business, encompassing satellite components, satellite buses, and mission operations. This vertical integration aims to capture more value within the space ecosystem and create a more resilient business model.\n\n* **Key Acquisitions:** RKLB has made several key acquisitions to build its space systems capabilities, including:\n   * **Alto Astronautics (satellite buses):** Enhancing capabilities for medium-sized satellites.\n   * **Sinclair Interplanetary (reaction wheels):** A leading supplier of attitude control components.\n   * **PSC (Photon satellite component and software):** Providing standardized satellite platforms and mission design tools.\n   * **QEY Innovation (flight software):** Bolstering software development.\n   * **SolAero (solar panels):** A key power source component for satellites.\n   * **Ball Aerospace's aerospace business (satellite platforms, sensors):** A significant expansion into advanced satellite components and platforms.\n* **Revenue Contribution:** Space Systems revenue has grown significantly, now constituting a substantial portion of RKLB's total revenue. In Q4 2023, Space Systems revenue was $71 million, an increase of 13% year-over-year. For the full year 2023, Space Systems revenue was $271 million, up 23% year-over-year.\n* **Synergies:** The integration of space systems provides RKLB with a unique advantage: offering customers a comprehensive solution from satellite design and manufacturing to launch and mission operations. This \"one-stop-shop\" approach can foster stronger customer loyalty and command premium pricing."

Aside from reaction wheels and solar panels, they do satellite busses and custom satellites which is definitely a decent revenue driver, but imo a lot of this revenue growth is already priced in at current levels. They\u2019ll always get NASA launch contracts but on the commercial launch market it\u2019s becoming increasingly commoditised and imo whoever has the lowest launch cost per kg will absolutely dominate. I like the neutron program but it\u2019s definitely a more limited service than say a starship rideshare or Blue Origin launch or something. I hear people say \u201cif neutron gets 30% of the launches a year\u201d estimates but with them being undoubtedly more expensive I think their customers will be mostly more be around smaller missions that need a perfectly precise orbit insertion, instead of like mega constellation deployment where the mega money is\n\nIf they get cheaper I\u2019d go back in but as of right now I think it\u2019s growth is mostly priced in"

        "text": "# Risk Assessment and Counterarguments\n\nDespite the significant upside potential, several risks and counterarguments need consideration.\n\n* **Neutron Development Delays and Failures:** The aerospace industry is notorious for schedule slips and technical challenges. A significant delay or failure in Neutron's maiden launch could severely impact investor confidence and RKLB's market position. The original post acknowledges the difficulty of sticking to timelines in this sector.\n* **Competition Intensification:** SpaceX continues to innovate with Starship, which could eventually offer even greater payload capacity and cost efficiencies, potentially encroaching on Neutron's market. Other competitors are also striving to fill the medium-lift gap.\n* **Market Commoditization:** While RKLB aims for differentiated offerings, the launch market, particularly for certain types of missions, is prone to commoditization, pressuring margins. The ability to offer truly unique value propositions and maintain cost leadership will be crucial.\n* **Capital Intensive Nature:** Space launch and manufacturing are incredibly capital-intensive. RKLB's growth strategy requires ongoing investment, which could necessitate future fundraising or dilutive equity offerings, as hinted by mentions of past ATM offerings.\n* **Valuation Concerns:** The original post suggests a price target of $120 by EOY, representing a significant increase. This raises questions about whether current market valuations adequately reflect the execution risks and the timeline for achieving such targets. As one comment points out, \"Neutron success projection is most certainly priced in.\" However, the *demonstrated* success is a different matter.\n* **Geopolitical Instability:** While the DoD's desire for alternatives to SpaceX could benefit RKLB, broader geopolitical events, trade restrictions, or changes in government spending priorities could impact contract awards and market access.\n\n# Future Trajectories and Strategic Implications\n\nThe successful execution of Rocket Lab's strategy positions it for substantial long-term growth and diversification.\n\n* **Scenario 1: Neutron Success & Market Dominance (High Probability):** If Neutron performs as expected, enabling reliable and cost-effective access to space for larger payloads, RKLB could capture significant market share in government and commercial launch. Coupled with a growing Space Systems business, this scenario could lead to substantial revenue growth and profitability, potentially justifying higher valuations. The potential for a \"SpaceX alternative\" narrative is powerful.\n* **Scenario 2: Incremental Growth & Diversification (Moderate Probability):** Even with some Neutron delays or minor setbacks, RKLB's established Electron business and expanding Space Systems segment provide a solid foundation. This scenario would see steady revenue growth, with Neutron gradually contributing more as it matures. The company would remain a key player, but perhaps not the dominant force envisioned in Scenario 1.\n* **Scenario 3: Stagnation or Setback (Low Probability):** A major failure of Neutron or continued inability to secure significant contracts could lead to stagnation or a significant revaluation of the company. However, RKLB's existing Electron business and its diversification efforts provide some resilience against a complete collapse."

Nobody ever means 'this exact price right now' when they say priced in, it's always within a few points. \n\nNeutron launching and SUCCEEDING is definitely not priced in because it opens an entirely new sector to them.\n\nIf anything is 'priced in' it's that Neutron WON'T launch this year despite RKLB saying it is.\n\nThere is NO realm that a successful launch is priced in because they're an instant competitor to Space-X AND they have the ability to deploy while Space-X 'just' delivers.\n\nIt'll be a huge 20-50% jump the following week after the success, followed by a slight pullback as people take the money. Then you'll get people buying in at the dip again before another rip on successful Neutron 2, showing it wasn't a 'fluke.'"

This strategy allows it to benefit from the entire value chain, from component manufacturing to satellite assembly and launch.\n* **Defense Sector Pivot:** The increasing focus on national security space applications, coupled with a desire for redundancy beyond a single provider (SpaceX), creates a significant opportunity for RKLB to become a critical defense contractor.\n* **Investment in Next-Gen Capabilities:** RKLB's continued investment in Neutron, and potentially future vehicle development, signals a long-term vision to remain at the forefront of space access technology.\n\nThe confluence of potential contract wins, the upcoming Neutron launch, and the ongoing growth in the space systems segment presents a compelling investment thesis for Rocket Lab. The key will be the company's ability to execute its ambitious roadmap, mitigate the inherent risks of the space industry, and leverage its diversified capabilities to capture a significant share of the rapidly expanding space economy."

Well, in my experience market doesn\u2019t run on overvalued or undervalued, only on emotions. \nPrice seems pretty low currently so I bought in.\n\nThe Trade Desk (TTD) continues to demonstrate its strength as a long-term investment in the evolving digital advertising space. The company\u2019s robust demand-side platform enables advertisers to manage and optimize data-driven campaigns across various channels, including connected TV (CTV)\u2014a segment growing rapidly as traditional TV declines. CEO Jeff Green has previously stated, \u201cWe process more transactions in one day than Visa does in a year,\u201d underscoring the scale and efficiency of their real-time bidding architecture. TTD\u2019s platform is built on transparency and independence, positioning it well against walled gardens like Google and Meta.\n\nInstitutional confidence in TTD is also rising. Notably, Intech Investment Management LLC boosted its stake by over 5,700%, Los Angeles Capital Management LLC initiated a $68.6 million position, and ARK Invest (Cathie Wood) recently added 210,664 shares (~$29.5M) to its ARKW fund. LaFleur & Godfrey LLC and several others have also increased exposure. These large bets from respected hedge funds signal strong conviction in TTD\u2019s scalability and future cash flow.\n\nGiven its proven leadership, deep industry integration, and consistent innovation in programmatic ad tech, TTD is well-positioned for long-term growth\u2014especially as advertisers shift more spend toward measurable, real-time channels like CTV.\n\nMy positions included. This is not financial advice. Invest or not, at your own risk.",

A few years ago I had heard that Rolls Royce was working on Nuclear Powered Rockets, and thought that would be fun. ( Makes me think of Halo reach space ships) \n\nI had a small amount of cash leftover in my Roth IRA and purchased RYCEY, and wow has it blown up; granted its been a few years coming.\n\n  \nNot a professional, and never made a DD before, but it still feels like space and Nuclear are on a roll of sorts, and have more to come in the future. Maybe buying into RYCEY right now is worth a shot? \n\nCurrently I only have around $7500 to spare, and I added back into RDW when I saw that dip below $8 a share! \n\n  \nGood luck to everyone out there and I hope all of your investments do well.",

I okayed them to liquidate if needs be so I may start a new portfolio again. But they did and found that I had cumulatively acquired a lot more than they expected.  In fact, due to my inability to actively manage my brokerage account someone was in the process of claiming my assets as an abandoned account, in which I felt that it may had seemed that way at the time, and thought to understand until I found my assets removed from the accounts inventory and placed elsewhere in my account in a folder that was only used to offer options to me or the public. In which it was being sold out from under me without my knowledge. \nAll in all, I had been going through arbitrations since March 2024, and it was going on since 2020. Now that\u2019s what had me seeking SEC & SIPC\u2019s help in rectifying this from going any further.  Recently I had  a Supreme Court\u2019s Final Judgment partially in my favor due to fees and penalties for unfounded accusations by the brokerage who made up these outrageous statements defamation of  my character in my invested interests which has no grounds except the that i once got juked in purchasing crypto from a client of theirs I met in their chat groups who disappeared before I caught on, due to my ignorance of the validity of it\u2019s value, thinking it\u2019s like all the other investments that disappeared along with my original account with the very same brokerage. This has made my life a living hell for over a year in which without access to my assets left me high and dry losing my home, car, relationship, and the respect from my own children who thought I was lying to them or trying to isolate them from my financial assistance. \nWhat should I do now that it\u2019s all returned back to me? How do I keep this from happening again? Because the people i trusted most turned on me at the chance of claiming my wealth and leaving me out to dry with nothing?"

It doesn't matter if they WERE a leap - there's only 3DTE.\n\nAs for the question posed by u/DifferentIdeal4420 - you're roughly $13 OTM (assume $237) with 3DTE... before open tomorrow, market thinks there's about a 1/4 chance RDDT will spike and regain ground (delta ~.25) which is why your extrinsic value is still so high (~4.10). IV is high and this will significantly drop each day if RDDT doesn't start moving upward. By tomorrow, your odds are probably about ~15%. You can check your delta before you decide.\n\nIt's not impossible, but the odds are not in your favor, so it comes down to whether you want to bet the entire premium or guaranteed lose just a fraction of it.\n\nSince this is WSB, I recommend you bet it all. Come back to us with screenshots of the result and how many nuggies you charge for your services, once you move behind Wendy's."

This worked amazingly at first as it multiplied their leverage and investors poured money into them (also leveraged). The stock prices of the trusts rocketed to massive premiums so they issued more and more stock to take advantage of the demand. And number kept going up.\n\n\nThen one day it went pop and all the investment trusts collapsed and lost all their investor's money in a few days because they were all hopelessly entangled and the underlying assets were worthless bits of paper.\n\n\nGood job we've got strong regulators who would stop that kind of thing happening today."

There have been a few option plays throughout the year but for most of it the combined gains relate to standard stock plays. My current big ones being:\n\nMU - $13,483.76 (84.21%)\n\nNVDA - $16,072.01 (41.14%)\n\nOKLO - 30,016.55 (420.24%) \n\nQS - $12,492.40 (138.59%)\n\nBig Ls\n\nLUNR - -$7,386.70 (41.33%)\n\nMy fake girlfriend and her boyfriend are tired of hearing about it so was hoping to get some praise from rando degens on the internet. 10 years ago I was starting my entry level job with a fresh $68,000 of student loan debt attached to my name so just know anyone can get lucky.",

Being said - lots of shit / potential catalysts around this one that I am unsure if market has priced in yet. Look at all NVDA's recent partnerships (OpenAI in particular - I'm looking at you). I believe micron provides the memory for nvidia GPU's and it may have potential to go brr. Dunno - it's an ER play. I actually don't really know what these guys do to be honest, just lots of chatter & I blindly trusted chat. I'm likely rotating out of micron within a week. These were bought this morning as I rotated out of $SNAP calls. I didn't like how options were priced on this one so monkeyed into shares instead.\n\nIt's already ran 40% last month, so high risk. I love buying the top.\n\nGoodluck to all in the cino\n\n\\[Update\\] Literally flat. Boring. My call about options being overpriced was correct, these are up \\~0.5% if AH holds tomorrow. Glad I bought shares & didn't play options here. Theta gang printing tho. I'm up like 5-10k on the AH movement. Theta gang & shares won this one.\n\n\\[Update 2\\] Might make like 1.5-2% on these tomorrow. Seems to be trending upwards. Lots of people bullish in the other threads - suggesting a hold is an alright bet. My read about overpriced vol seems to be correct tho - options are not the play on this one. I'll update chat when I exit. Goodluck to all. ",

Fundamentals drive people to feel good or bad about an investment, and they only time they buy or sell is if they feel really good or bad about it. Fundamentals is one thing people use as a source to give them conviction \"this is good\" or \"this is bad\" - which gives them the feeling to buy or sell. Many value investors use it as their primary driver - whereas meme / vibe traders completely ignore it. Fundamental traders: \"This is undervalued! BUY!\". Vibe traders \"LOL, The CEO wore these pants and that was funny. Fuck it, I'm in\".\n\nBoth have the same effect on the market.\n\nMany meme / vibe traders drastically outperform. Why? -> the only thing that actually moves markets is when people buy or sell - not fundamentals. They're trading the traders, not fundamentals. I tend to trade sentiment - which is the union of all investment styles (IE: I try to figure out what are you buying???). This one had a lot of bulls (perhaps too many tbh) - which makes this high risk for me & is why I rotated into shares instead of options. Lower risk.\n\nGoodluck in the casino!"

People don't meme there. WSB's is a degenerate gambling forum. Read the room - over \\~75% of people here were bullish on MU earnings. I've been following it for a few weeks. Follow the majority is generally a winning bet. Doesn't mean it's right tho - good chance many already bought and take profits on earnings - causing a drop. Not many bears on this one - suggesting that yes - puts may pay"

    "text": "$SNAP - Final update. Rolled all options profits into shares (20k share freeroll)\nSame shit I did on my other plays. I trade options which I believe are underpriced, tend to very quickly take profits (usually in < 2 weeks, despite the fact I'm trading leaps) and roll profits into the underlying. IE: $SNAP. IMO this one is likely to run over 10 after the next ER's (the drop was due to a bug in their advertising platform). I stand by my previous investment + DD.\n\nMy trading style involves using leaps / far expiration options for risk mitigation (ie: if my thesis is wrong - I can just keep holding / re-evaluate) & to leverage my bets. This one made me \\~16-18% in a week, which is a fantastic return IMO. I got a 20k snap share freeroll out of it - which IMO should pay very well. I don't like following things long term with options, so just hold shares on things I previously followed.\n\nFor evidence of risk mitigation - look at my history for how I played GTLB. I bought before ER's and they ate a -12% overnight (while I was long OTM calls). I woke up to a \\~25% unrealized loss. I held for 2 weeks and managed to sell for a \\~5% profit - as I re-evaluated risk matrix after the drop & decided it was positive EV to continue to hold.\n\nI only follow a few tickers at once & never went broke from taking profits. Rotating my trading capital elsewhere into another (imo) undervalued thing. There's a few on my radar.\n\n\\- Paperhands +2.3m now\n\nGoodluck to all in the cino\n\n\\[update\\] Trading capital went into MU shares for an ER play. See my other post.",

So I kinda just guess what they're likely to do based off what they're chatting about & I create matricies labelled \"dumb money/smart money, bullish/bearish\". I look for ones where smart / dumb money are in polar opposite corners - it tends to be a good bet.\n\nReality is: I don't give a fuck about what you're buying. But - if you're buying I want in too. That simple. It could be a glitter covered basket and if you want it - I do too. Why?? If you want it, good chance I can buy it and sell it to the market for more than I bought it for."

So really the way to win is as simple as: \"Identify what the monkeys are buying / saying, monkey in, let them buy, then monkey out\". That's what I try to do...

    "text": "RedCat because I LOVE kitty \ud83d\udc31\n\n\nSecretary of Defense, Hegseth\u2019s drone dominance orders are favoring drone stocks and is a clear no brainer. \n\nThe order removed prior DOD policies from 2021 and 2022 that restricted the U.S. military from buying drones and components made by Chinese companies. It also assigns to combat units authority to buy, test and train with small UAS drones that comply with statutes, according to reports.\n\n\"While our adversaries have produced millions of cheap drones before us we were mired in bureaucratic red tape,\" Hegseth said in the video online. \"Not anymore.\"\n\nThe memo aims to bolster U.S. drone manufacturing by \"approving hundreds of American products\" for military purchase. It also calls to leverage private capital that supports the industry. The DOD plans to arm combat units with a \"variety of low-cost drones\" made by American engineers and AI experts.\n\nThe order will also expand the Blue List of DOD-approved unmanned drones, components and software, as part of a collaboration between the Defense Innovation Unit and the Defense Contract Management Agency, according to reports. The DOD in 2020 established an effort called Blue UAS, which is the process for certifying commercial drones for military use.\n\n\"Modern battlefield innovation demands a new procurement strategy that fuses manufacturers with our front line troops,\" the memo said.\n\nLastly, the DOD plans to integrate drones into relevant combat training starting next year, which includes force-on-force drone wars.\n\n\"Lethality will not be hindered by self-imposed restrictions, especially when it comes to harnessing technologies we invented but were slow to pursue,\" Hegseth wrote in the memo.\n\nThe announcement builds on a June 6 executive order from the White House to invest in drone technology and integrate it into the national airspace.\n\nAs of their recent Town Hall announcement, RedCat has finally received the green light from the Army to announce LRIP (Low Rate Initial Production) portion of the SRR contract. Announcing 690 systems rather previous 550. Their guidance for fiscal year is 80-120M projected to hit 55M for Q3 this year. Today, they announced their first delivery of 45 systems for a total of $3.5M. We did the numbers and it took them approximately 3.4 days to deliver 45 drones, which indicates they can easily produce, deliver and execute. \n\nFollowing news today, RedCat\u2019s Black Widow just got approved for the NATO NSPA Catalogue signaling NATO countries likely to purchase RedCat\u2019s drones. \n\nThey recently did an offering for 170M that got gobbled up by tutes and they exercised underwritten options\n\nTLDR: Drone warfare is here. American drone dominance is here. Plan to outpace China which means $$$$$ for drone industry. RedCat won SRR contract beating 30+ competitors for it. Meeting the supply demand for the contract. \nHas connections to current administration. Approved for NATO. \n\nI am 7k shares long. ",

Lulu makes their money off of poor, fat women who think they can offset their obesity coefficient by wearing the same leggings as the attractive women that make better decisions than them. That all falls apart when their card declines due to lack of funds and Klarna goes out of business.\n\nThe Amex deal attempts to get their preferred demographic wearing their clothes again, conveniently timed with the non-preferred demographic being unable to afford it, and they outnumber the preferred demographic. The most charitable interpretation of this is that it's a 1:1 swap of non-preferred demo to preferred demo. At worst, it's a desperate move to protect what little revenue they can expect to keep."

    "text": "Calls on CROX\nI do some volunteer work, and I feel like crocs have always been pretty common. However this year, they are EVERYWHERE. With how prevalent they are you would think its Nike or something. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say half the kids are wearing crocs, so I think they must\u2019ve crushed it in their back to school sales.\n\nCROX is down 30% YTD and fell from $105 to $75 on its most recent earnings due to weak guidance. It reports its next earnings on November 4th and I think it is due for a massive turnaround. \n\nPositions:\n20x 85C expiring in December\n\n\n",

Then the stock crashes it 20% the next day because they said the company was going to be hit hard due to tariffs.\n\nSince the administration have been pushing back the tariffs so many times, Passes me the impression that companies that produce in China are not going to get affected and the bad ones will use tariffs as an excuse for lower sales.\n\nI'm glad I didn't bought calls because I was doing another bet. For this one, I am not so sure.\n\nWish you the best."

Recently had to get him white ones because everyone is wearing white ones.  One of his dad\u2019s friends started wearing them and said he only got them for hardwood instead of ruining sneakers and wears them all the time.  After a year of considering trying a pair I bought a pair and will agree I love them.  Wife hates how they look but very comfy and convenient.   And stores often have lines at the holidays."

    "text": "GENI YOLO\nIs anyone else in GENI this thing is gonna rip!\n\nGenius Sports (GENI) \u2013 Equity Research Report\n\nRating: Buy | Price Target: $40/share\n\nCompany Overview\nGenius Sports is a leading provider of official sports data, video, and media technology services. It operates in three segments: Betting Technology & Services, Media Technology & Services, and Sports Technology & Services. Its core business revolves around delivering low-latency, official data feeds, integrity solutions, and media/ad-tech solutions to sportsbooks, leagues, and advertisers.\n\nIndustry Structure: The Duopoly\nThe global sports data industry has consolidated into a duopoly between Genius Sports and Sportradar. Most top-tier leagues have signed official rights contracts with one of these two players.\nThis grants both companies pricing power, sticky multi-year contracts, and significant barriers to entry. Sportradar's acquisition of IMG Arena and Genius Sports' extended NFL exclusive rights through 2030 reinforce this structure.\n\nCatalyst: December 3, 2025 Investor Day\nOn December 3, 2025, Genius Sports will host its Investor Day in New York City. The company will demonstrate its product suite, growth strategy, and financial outlook. Investors are expected to gain a clearer understanding of the depth, breadth, and strength of Genius\u2019 rapidly growing Media segment, guided to grow at least 60% YoY in 2H-2025. The Investor Day will likely highlight product demos, fan intelligence capabilities (via the Sports Innovation Lab acquisition), and advertising integrations, which may catalyze investor confidence and support valuation re-rating.\n\nMedia Business Growth\nGenius\u2019 Media business, driven by FANHub, ad-tech integrations, and fan intelligence tools, is the fastest-growing part of the company. With ~60% YoY growth guided for H2-2025, management aims to establish Media as a core driver of margin expansion. This segment is expected to mature into a higher-margin, software-like business, improving Genius\u2019 overall profitability profile.\n\nWhy Genius Sports and Sportradar Are the Visa & Mastercard of Sports Betting\n\u2022 Two-Sided Networks: They connect leagues (rights owners) with sportsbooks/media operators,similar to how Visa/Mastercard connect merchants and cardholders.\n\u2022 Mission-Critical Infrastructure: Official live data feeds are indispensable for in-play betting, just as cardrails are essential for commerce.\n\u2022 Duopoly Resilience: Like Visa and Mastercard, two scaled networks coexist globally, ensuringredundancy and pricing balance.\n\u2022 Embedded Growth: Both are layering new services (media, AI, video) like Visa/Mastercard layeredfraud prevention, cross-border fees, and loyalty.\n\u2022 High Switching Costs: Sportsbooks cannot risk losing official feeds, echoing merchants\u2019 dependenceon card networks.\nPath to $40/share\nGENI trades around $12.79 today. To reach $40 (~$10B equity value), the company must scale revenue from ~$645M in 2025 to ~$1.2\u20131.3B by 2027\u20132028, with adjusted EBITDA margins expanding to 25\u201330% or more. That would yield ~$350\u2013$400M EBITDA. At a premium 25x EV/EBITDA multiple, supported by duopoly economics and rapid Media growth, GENI\u2019s valuation aligns with $40/share.\n\nExhibit: GENI Share Price Bridge to $40\n\nRisks\n\u2022 Rights renewal risk: leagues may demand higher economics or switch providers.\n\u2022 Ad-market cyclicality could slow Media growth if brand budgets decline.\n\u2022 Competitive pressure from Sportradar or new entrants in specific markets.\n\u2022 Regulatory risks affecting betting, advertising, or data usage.\nConclusion\nGenius Sports and Sportradar stand as the two strongest business models in the global sports betting industry, analogous to Visa and Mastercard in payments. Both firms benefit from scale, rights exclusivity, and embedded network effects. With rapid Media growth, a clear duopoly, and the upcoming December 2025 Investor Day as a catalyst, we see GENI\u2019s path to $40/share as realistic within 2\u20133 years. We assign a Buy rating with a $40/share price target.",

To this day, I still have a few dozen shares in my Roth IRA, and as of a few months ago was down 98% on them. I decided to keep these until the company would go bankrupt to remind me of the reality of buying the hype, and then it never did. I'm so confused that this stock popped again, bringing my return to only -90%, when the last time I checked they're further away from making money now than they were 5 years ago. I may double or triple my position, which means adding a few hundred dollars, just for shit and giggles."

In the past, when governments got too repressive or too removed from the needs of the people, they were overthrown. But modern surveillance tech stands to make that a thing of the past. \n\nThe US is partially shielded due to it\u2019s democracy & norms, but those are just a buffer. If you project current trends we\u2019ll be just as repressive as China in a decade or two, and past that point nothing short of societal collapse will be able to shake up the entrenched power structures."

This isn\u2019t a growing company people are testing it out and then leaving or finding their own solution.\n\nAny revenue growth (it\u2019s not really growing consistently anyways) is just squeezing their current clients more.\n\nThis connector type UI is easier to make than ever and there are other companies that do it with more capabilities popping up every day with broader capabilities (lovable bolt even bubble).  They aren\u2019t a leader in the automation space like zapier or make.\n\nSo they\u2019re a niche company in an increasingly competitive area selling a technology that\u2019s been leapfrogged.

Fossil fuels. Renewable emissions and materials are front-loaded. They are actually very green and minimize fossil fuel use.

    "text": "YOLO $600k+ speculation on MUX as Barrick M&A target\nCommodities like gold, silver, and uranium have the sex appeal for investors doing moon math on free cash flow from rising commodity prices. However, looking at the strategic focus of mining majors, they are in love with copper, especially supermassive, cheap copper porphyry deposits up in the Andes in newly liberalized Argentina. Case in point is the recent Teck+Anglo merger, a harbinger of M&A to come in the copper space.\n\nMost of the juicy Andes copper deposits have been taken by the Lundin clan, but MUX has one remaining supermassive copper project in Los Azules. Doing napkin math on Los Azules economics at current copper prices gets a NPV that suggests MUX's Los Azules stake easily exceeds the enterprise value of MUX, not counting McEwen's substantial though mediocre gold mining operations.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fjp6nir5qqqf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cb2c56e12b8146accf6099bcaa23e1c941cffa6\n\nI see Barrick as most likely acquirer given their existing operations in the same San Juan province of Argentina, given their nearby Veladero JV with Shandong Gold. Most of their operational/regulatory know-how readily translates out to building Los Azules. In my eye, the Los Azules dream team would be Barrick as operator, and Shandong Gold/Rio Tinto/McEwen Mining as minority equity partners given operational, technological, and exploration expertise on the Los Azules geology. In my calculation, Barrick could plausibly build out Los Azules with fronting just a couple hundred million of project equity with these partners, writing a royalty to FNV/WPM, and taking reasonable levels of project debt.\n\nThe other potential operator is Rio Tinto who is already on the Los Azules cap table. While Rio has nearby Argentina operations, they are in the Salta province and their workforce/operational knowledge is less readily translatable to Los Azules.\n\nMUX has a long-awaited technical report on Los Azules coming out next month. It has been delayed a couple times, and my read of the delays is that they are due to scope creep, i.e. positive surprises that necessitate further exploration/testing than originally envisioned. MUX has verbally indicated plans for an IPO of the stake and potentially building out the project themselves, but IMO this is just positioning/angling for stronger hand in M&A negotiations. Either way, once that technical report comes out, I believe the stock can move very quickly.\n\nWish me luck as I have a degenerately large portfolio fraction on this bet. I plan to hold options into year end and may trade in and out of shares.\n\n**Disclaimer: This is purely my own speculation with no confirmations, my napkin math has been very wrong in the past. I am not an investment professional, this is not investment advice.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ynexopmtrqqf1.png?width=1445&format=png&auto=webp&s=aba9a277ede7248c45aad51ca4b190fa24687f7b",

McEwen crew seemed genuinely upbeat at recent Rule Symposium conference and stock price has been up since, so my bias is that the delay is positive in nature. \n\nThey may very well delay again, I'm willing to hold through either way."

They will definitely keep growing, but what is unclear is how fast of a growth rate they can maintain:\n\n- ChatGPT subscriptions can continue to grow, but there are only so many businesses/consumers that can pay for subscriptions. The landscape is also very competitive(Gemini, Grok, Anthropic, etc), so their pricing power is limited.\n\n- API is a huge growth engine, in my opinion. The more websites/applications that implement AI into their product, the more recurring revenue there is. IMO API revenues will eventually be their fastest growing source of revenue- it takes time for devs to build infrastructure around their product, but once its built, you have growth from both new applications being built, and existing applications scaling.\n\n- On the consumer side, ads are a tremendous market. As a comparison, Google does nearly $400 Billion a year in revenue. If OpenAI implements ads in the free plan of ChatGPT(a huge source of losses currently), it would greatly improve their margins and potentially unlock hundreds of billions in revenue.\n\nI actually think OpenAI's $500 Billion valuation is reasonable. Google is a $3 Trillion company, and OpenAI could replace them as the go-to search tool. The main risk for them is their high rate of cash burn and dilution; the big question is how quickly will they achieve profitability?\n\nMy bigger concern is actually smaller AI companies like X.AI. They are much less profitable, and the only thing keeping them afloat is their connection to Musk."

Since they signed a contract to buy each AAPL share at $203/share on 10/22 no matter the price, and at the time of close out each share had risen to (currently sitting at) $255/share, that\u2019s an automatic profit of $52/share. \n\nI thought you had the option to just not buy the stock if the price went down by the close out date, so you wouldn\u2019t lose or gain money.

You're right in basics that each options represents the ability to buy 100 shares of a stock at a given price. So this call lets OP buy 100 shares of Apple at $230. When you buy it you pay a premium for the ability. OP paid $414 for the right to buy 100 shares of apple at $230.\n\n  \nYou can buy and sell the option anytime before the expiration date, but the price will go up and down relative to the share price, at a really basic level just scaled because it represents 100 shares. But it's way more complicated than that because the value of option will change.\n\nThe short is you'll gain more money if the price goes up (to a point), and you'll lose money as the price goes down (also to a point), than just owning shares."

If the stock had gone up further in the same time frame OP could have made even more bank.\n\nHe is lucky to make that kind of profit at all. It seems the market didn't expect aapl to do as well as they did because usually these changes would already be priced into the premium. I am honestly confused why that didn't happen because aapl is relatively stable and it shouldn't come as a surprise that the stock goes up slow but steady.\n\nI see no logical reason why OP got such great returns here. It's very likely that any stock increases are already priced in and you can't sell the options so they'll expire worthlessly. Most of time you'd probably be lucky to merely break even where it's just barely in the money so you get your initial investment back but nothing else.\n\nThat's why I never tried buying calls. You invest 20 grand and if you're lucky at all you'll break even or make a small profit instead of losing it all. Really shocked how OP was able to beat the market and with aapl out of all stocks..."

This isn\u2019t magic, it\u2019s just how the market works, though you can model and calculate it. If I asked you to pay me $5 for the ability to buy apple at the current price next week, you\u2019d be less likely to take that than if I asked you to pay me $5 for a chance to purchase it at the current price two years from now.\n\nApple is now basically near ath again, so OP probably bought when apple was on a downswing and it came back up.\n\nBut options still respect underlying changes as long as they are happening faster than the general time decay."

There's still the statistical data that says over time you'll average out at a bottom line of zero so the big question for me is: Do I start out buying calls and end up 80 grand in the hole and give up or do I make a profit like OP? I know which one is more likely. Really wish I were more knowledeable but at least I know that I am clueless which is worth something."

It\u2019s a US semiconductor manufacturer sitting at the intersection of two secular themes: (1) Domestic, trusted supply of US military chips, and (2) picks and shovels exposure to quantum computing.\n\n**Core defense/specialty foundry (\\~80% of revenue)**\n\n* Skywater is one of 12 DMEA category 1-A trusted foundries certified to supply chips to the US DoD. For those of you too lazy to look up what that means, this is basically the Fort Knox of chip fabs, and it\u2019s hard to get. Unlike peers embedded in large conglomerates (BAE, Raytheon, ON),\u00a0**SKYT is one of the ONLY public pureplays on US military chip fabrication**.\n\n**SKYT has two important facilities:**\n\n* Florida advanced packaging: the DoD awarded SKYT $120mm (with options up to $190mm) to build this out. It is trusted & accredited and almost ready to start ramping. Outputs will be used in\u00a0**drones, electronic warfare, guided munitions, and space avionics.**\n* Austin fab: this was owned by Infineon and SKYT is acquiring it. It was not \u201ctrusted\u201d before, but under Skywater, it will be. It previously specialized in industrial/auto end markets, but now will be eligible to supply chips for\u00a0**drones, satellites, missiles, and comms gear.**\n\n**Quantum & Photonics (\\~20% of revenue)**\n\n* Donald mentioned the word \u201cquantum\u201d 5 times in his speech with Starmer last week. The hype cycle is in full swing. And Skywater is the classic picks and shovels play.\n* While every PhD with a powerpoint is burning through VC cash\\*\\*, Skywater is one of the only companies actually getting paid\\*\\*.\u00a0 They provide essential foundry services and photonics platforms that quantum players need for their chips and devices. Management has called out double digit y/y growth, and if quantum really takes off, this business could hockey stick.\n\n**Policy Tailwinds & Strategic Importance**\n\n* The CEO, Thomas Sonderman, has been busy in Washington. Just earlier this month he was seen at the White House with top brass, including Michael Kratsios, the Chief Technology Officer of the United States. Kratsios is responsible for crafting the US quantum strategy (photos attached).\n   * [Michael J.K Kratsios - Department of War Bio](https://www.war.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/2279091/michael-jk-kratsios/)\n* SKYT is already in the club. They\u2019re pre-vetted and pre-funded. Next up could be CHIPs grants, new DoD IDIQs/OTAs, and though a long shot, maybe even a direct government equity check.\n\n**Why Now?**\n\n* \u201cQuantum\u201d is getting publicity at the highest levels. Attention = budgets.\n* SKYT\u2019s Florida facility is nearly ready to ramp. This probably means some big DoD orders are on the way. They paid for it after all.\u00a0\n* At today\u2019s market cap, you\u2019re buying a critical part of the US defense/quantum supply chain at a total bargain.\u00a0\n\n**TLDR:** $SKYT is a tiny company with a license to print money from the Pentagon. They are one of the only pureplays building \"Made in the USA\" chips for the military. They are also the picks and shovels play for the quantum computing industry, collecting tolls from whoever wins. Technology. Skywater already has a seat at the table and is Chummy with DOD Pals.\n\n**Position:** Nov/Dec/Jan $20 Call\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ijzpdwq92qqf1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ec40e391d03bc9e96f55c44c329f1d8b56f8f91f\n\n",

I took out $4,400 to pay myself back and buy a reward for myself. It has been fun and there have definitely been ups and downs. I attached screenshots of the withdrawal/deposit page so you can see there was only one deposit and one withdrawal. Last two screenshots are some of the big wins.",

I just bought 60DTE calls on a silver ETF for 50$, and same date 8$ calls on a company called new gold.  I just keep feeling like the macro risks here are going to fuck me bad.\n\nCan anybody help me out.. I dont have level 3 yet, otherwise I'd be selling put spreads or buying wide call spreads against overpriced vol at the wings..  I'm not afraid of short strats but I honestly dont feel I have the capital to be risking short quite yet"

Always give yourself ample time, short term option plays are sexy but can be very miserable if you get it wrong.\n\n2. Never force a trade. Don't feel like you have to make a play. If nothing is standing out to you then just sit on cash until you find something you believe in.\n\n3. Know when to cut losses. Nobody is going to win 100% of the time, get good at living to die another day.\n\nThe main strategy that I have been following is just trading companies that I believe are under/over-valued with minimum 90 days til expiration contracts. Right now I am loaded to the brim on GOOGL June 2026 $250 calls."

Like it or not, google helped content creators to monetize their content by sending them traffic via search, and content creators allowed google\u2019s search crawlers to scrape and archive their websites in return. The rub is google\u2019s search crawlers are exempted from the actions taken by the likes of Cloudflare to proactively block AI crawlers to access their clients\u2019 websites for free. \n\nMuch like apple and google say they aren\u2019t eavesdropping via their phones (yet you say swedish dick pumpers three times like you\u2019re conjuring beetlegeuise, and lo\u2019 and behold ads start appearing), you know the search crawler is feeding the Gemini models."

While their result still matter (bad losses will lose you capacity providers), it\u2019s a different risk profile than directly investing in insurers.\n\nNeptune can write in all 50 states so while they are Florida based that doesn\u2019t mean all their exposure is there.

The reform bill includes a tax increase on :insert random shit: to fund discounts on the purchase of insurance through the marketplace. Conveniently, the bill will also of course fail to provide any meaningful regulations to the market in price control, payout amounts, timeliness of payouts, or whatever else. Most people will end up with plans subsidized by non-homeowner tax increases, that also fails to cover any flood damage excacerbated by winds, surge, tidal flooding, full moons, venus being in retrograde, or occurs on days ending in Y.\n\ndolla dolla bills y'all"

The comments are hilarious.\n\nWell my post almost perfectly marked the top in BYD, down 30% since i made it.\n\nAnd today we learn Buffett/Berkshire have completely exited their remaining position in the company.\n\nMaybe this is all just a coincidence, but i doubt it. Buffett has access to more information than the public does. And he used his inside information to turn you guys into exit liquidity while he quietly sold off his remaining stake.",

(They buy Toyota parts on the second hand market and rebuild it so it\u2019s exactly the same car) their early days logo also looked exactly like BMW or KIA\n\n\nThe reason why they\u2019re named BYD is also the CEO think KIA sounds and look so cool lol"

We have seen the S&P notch higher highs for more than a month straight, nonstop, all after having one of the biggest rallies seen in market history. Then we today we trade another 0.5% higher on the back of a $4.5 trillion company pumping almost 4% due to the news that they are investing in one of their customers so they can buy more of their products as they have done with quite a few players thus far.

A Better Approach From Escorts.\nThe Fed claims to balance price stability with maximum employment. In practice, both pillars are built on sand:\n\nJob creation data is constantly revised downward... the latest BLS revision wiped out 911,000 jobs like a bad typo.\n\nThe unemployment rate is essentially fan fiction. It counts gig workers, Uber drivers, OnlyFans creators, and yes, technically even escorts, prostitutes, hookers, and strippers as \u201cemployed.\u201d\n\nInflation at \u201c3%\u201d is a joke. My grocery bill, rent, and utilities all disagree.\n\nThe truth is, the economy runs on a far more honest set of forces: men\u2019s disposable income to spend on sex work and women\u2019s willingness to sell companionship.\n\nSo I propose a new, more accurate Dual Mandate for the Federal Reserve:\n\n1. Balance the number of men who can still afford escorts, prostitutes, hookers, strippers, and sugar babies.\n\n2. Balance the number of women entering sex work out of economic necessity.\n\n\nHere\u2019s the model:\n\nBad economy: More women enter the industry due to lack of alternatives while men cut back on spending\n\nGood economy: Fewer women stay in sex work since they have better alternatives; men who can afford it spend more\n\n\nForget CPI. The true measure of inflation is the Escort Asking Rate Index (EARI\u2122) a basket of advertised rates across cities. If her hourly goes up, it\u2019s because her rent, groceries, and Uber rides went up. That\u2019s a real-time, boots-on-the-ground measure of cost of living.\n\nSo if you want price stability and full employment? Look no further than the front page of Tryst and Seeking instead of opaque & confusing calculations done by economists\n\nAs a future Fed official, I\u2019ll ensure every FOMC meeting includes a robust discussion of escort pricing trends before setting interest rates. Powell had his dot plot. I\u2019ll have my thot plot.\n\nScott Bessent, my calendar is free next week for an interview.",

A situation where the price for basic services drops, but services requiring tangible goods to perform (foodplay, wigs, toys, pets, etc.) become more expensive would then signal the much dreaded stagflation. By nature this would only be observed in a more upscale economy and not necessarily show in the RED (roadside environment data)."

        "text": "> The true measure of inflation is the Escort Asking Rate Index (EARI\u2122)\n\nBro, what are you thinking? You missed the chance to use the true economy yardstick, the Prostitution Overnight Recreation Number (PORN\u2122).\n\nThe Prostitution Overnight Recreation Number (PORN) is a composite economic indicator designed to capture discretionary household spending on hedonic and leisure-related activities. PORN aggregates expenditures in four key domains: (1) commercial sex services (Prostitution), (2) short-term accommodation and travel lodging (Overnight), (3) leisure and cultural activities (Recreation), and (4) aggregate transaction volumes expressed as a normalized expenditure index (Number).\n\n**Purpose**\n\nPORN functions as a proxy for disposable income elasticity in urban economies, reflecting shifts in household confidence and non-essential consumption. Rising PORN values typically indicate robust consumer confidence and economic expansion, as households allocate greater portions of surplus income to hedonic markets. Conversely, declining PORN values often signal contractionary trends, reduced liquidity in discretionary spending, or heightened consumer uncertainty.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nPORN is calculated using sector-specific expenditure data, drawn from national accounts, industry surveys, and anonymized transaction-level datasets. Each component is indexed to a standardized base year and weighted according to its average share of household discretionary expenditure in OECD economies. The resulting composite is seasonally adjusted and reported quarterly.\n\n**Applications**\n\n* As a leading indicator of consumer sentiment and discretionary liquidity.\n\n* For cross-comparative analysis of urban nightlife economies.\n\n* To assess correlations between hedonic consumption and broader macroeconomic cycles.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nDue to the inclusion of sensitive or underreported market segments (e.g., prostitution), PORN should be interpreted cautiously. Estimates are subject to data availability, reporting inconsistencies, and varying legal frameworks across jurisdictions."

        "text": ">Like implying uber drivers and sex workers shouldn't be counted as employed for some reason.\n\nThey already don't because both are \"Independent contractors\". Independent contractors are already mostly excluded from many employment statistics. Uber drivers barely make like 12$ an hour after taxes and asset depreciation, the asset depreciation is something most drivers never truly factor in to their costs. Most only consider gas as an expense, but you put 80-100k miles on a car in the first year and you've cut the value of a brand new car in half. Also for an Uber driver to \"work\" 40 hours they over have to actually work over 50 actual hours. (Driving to location, waiting for new job etc). \n\nSex work is more akin to streaming, especially online sex work. Basically only the top earners in online sex work pull in significant sums, the rest make virtually nothing, and it's not a steady source of income.\n\nEdit: clarification on what \"most employment statistics\" means. \nICs count as employed for the purposes of BLS. Counterintuitively, ICs do not count as U1-U6 under/unemployment unless they are collecting unemployment from a different job they were let go from. The only way to count in the U1-U6 is to  be covered by/using the unemployment program. ICs typically don't qualify unless states intervene. \n\nIn other words they count as employed when they probably shouldn't and don't count as underemployed when they should. The worst of both cases."

You are \"self employed\" and therefore run your own business. BLS puts ICs into \"Contingent jobs and alternative work arrangements\" category. If this doesn't make sense to you, i'll phrase it like this... you cannot qualify for unemployment as an IC so how would you ever be considered under/unemployed? You can collect unemployment (after being lay'd off from a normal job) while working as IC. \n\nhttps://www.bls.gov/blog/2024/contingent-jobs-and-alternative-work-arrangements-what-you-need-to-know.htm"

AI boom is genuine which will translate to higher profits for companies who now need to spend less on employees, its a work force multiplier. Life will get worse for normal people as were seeing with profitability of companies increasing and an ever weakening dollar. 3% inflation and above will be the new norm. Stonks will continue to go up as people cant hold onto fiat currency likely assets such as bitcoin will also grow. Home prices will stay up and likely keep creeping up. Middle class will shrink poor class will increase. Homes don't need to to be affordable they instead will be traded amongst only the rich and rented back to us subsidized by the government as an ever increasing poor voting block gets bribed by their own tax dollars to replace the income they no longer have. Economy will worsen yet assets will rise. Your only hope is these print so short term during potential government shut down in October but betting against spy rn or any longer period isn't gonna print you're setting money on fire."

Panic-sold. Always too late. Missed the big bull runs.\n\nThen I thought: this can\u2019t go on. I dumped the trash, even when losses were small (or rumors were intense) and gave some stupid hope. That freed up my margin. I threw all the capital into major companies. Not just M7, but well spread out. Caught the rebounds of CRWD and SNPS \u2014 made real wins. Sold covered calls that actually made sense: smaller premiums, way less risk. Grabbed puts to lock down my biggest plays.\n\nResult: A few days later, +50%. Haven\u2019t seen numbers like that in over a year.\n\nTL;DR: Better miss 100 \u201cnext big things\u201d at under one dollar than looking for a job at the local McDonald's.",

The larger the market cap & shares of the stock, the greater predictability of those indicators. Then comparing that good financial tech analysis with crowdsourced opinions can lead to even better outcomes. \n\nCovered calls are a great strategy when not flipping stocks, which tells me your trades are more deliberate, reasoned and longer term. Don\u2019t know your age or investment horizon, but would also consider dividend paying stocks in addition to those you trade. Good luck."

If you\u2019re on PM, adding long puts or put spreads will increase your EL and decrease MM because of the way the IBKR risk engine calculates risk to your book. \n\nI\u2019m guessing that with that sort of SPX delta you running at least 4 or 5x leverage.

    "text": "Huge Micron Bet\nHey everyone,\n\nFirst time with a DD so forgive me if I sound regarded. \n\nThis is the biggest trade I am set up for and wanted to share my thoughts. \n\nI believe we are going to see a huge run up next Tuesday with Microns earnings call. Current price is $162 with the pull back with Samsungs announcement spooking the market but I believe this won\u2019t affect Microns future capabilities with HBM.  \n\nSo Micron Q4 earnings are coming up\u2026 and I\u2019m bullish. I took up a huge position with the underlying prior to the pump on Thursday. \n\nYesterday with the drop I loaded up at the bottom on 200 calls $175 expiring October 17. \n\nMy logic is this. \n\nSeeing what happened with Oracle over their guidance gives me confident we may expect something crazy from Micron, especially when their customers Nvidia, Amd, Microsoft, Amazon, Google all had record years. All of them just crushed it on AI and cloud growth.\n\nIf they\u2019re winning, Micron is too. Every GPU and every data center relies on Micron\u2019s memory to run. While there are 2 main competitors in the memory landscape (Samsung and SK Hynix) I believe Micron is well positioned regardless. \n\nLast quarter: $9.3B in revenue with nearly 50% growth in high-bandwidth memory sales.\n\nNext up: Management is guiding ~$10.7B for Q4 with stronger margins. I think they may beat expectations. \n\nIn all of the last 5 reported fiscal quarters listed above, Micron has beaten EPS expectations.  \ufffc\n\nThe beat amounts range from ~+$0.13 to ~+$0.34 in recent quarters.\n\nThe most recent (Q3 FY2025) was the largest beat in that sample, +$0.34\n\nHowever with this upcoming Q4 FY 2025, EPS consensus estimates are around $2.78-$2.86 per share. Year-over-year that\u2019s a big jump from ~$1.18 in Q4 FY2024.  \ufffc\n\t\nGross margin expectations have been revised up, reflecting tight supply + improved pricing (especially DRAM).\n\nAnalyst Quotes & Price Targets\n\nWedbush (Matt Bryson) \u2013 PT $200\n\n\u201cWedbush analyst Matt Bryson raised the firm\u2019s price target on Micron Technology to $200 from $165 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The firm notes that demand from cloud service providers has come in stronger than expected, which could significantly boost Micron\u2019s future sales and pricing power. Wedbush believes that the ongoing AI build-out is creating a structural uplift in demand for DRAM and high-bandwidth memory that will continue through 2026.\u201d \u3010Barron\u2019s\u3011\n\nBarclays \u2013 PT $175\n\n\u201cBarclays analysts raised their Micron target price to $175 from about $140, while maintaining an Overweight rating. The analysts acknowledged that some of the recent NAND chip orders coming out of Silicon Valley may be short-term in nature, but they believe Micron will likely exceed its current guidance. They also expect the company to offer a strong forward outlook as hyperscaler spending on AI infrastructure continues at an aggressive pace.\u201d \u3010Barron\u2019s\u3011\n\nDeutsche Bank (Melissa Weathers) \u2013 PT $175\n\n\u201cDeutsche Bank analyst Melissa Weathers lifted her price target on Micron shares from $155 to $175, reiterating a Buy rating. She noted that favorable market conditions for DRAM and high-bandwidth memory, particularly products tied to artificial intelligence data centers, are a major driver of upside. Weathers added that DRAM pricing has remained firm, supply is constrained, and demand for HBM in GPUs and servers is accelerating faster than the Street had anticipated.\u201d \u3010Investors.com\u3011\n\nMizuho (Vijay Rakesh) \u2013 PT $182\n\n\u201cMizuho Securities raised its price target on Micron to $182 and kept a Buy rating. Analyst Vijay Rakesh wrote that momentum around artificial intelligence and strong demand for high-bandwidth memory should continue to drive Micron\u2019s results higher. He cited tight supply in both DRAM and NAND, with pricing moving upward, as well as Micron\u2019s increasing share of AI-focused products. Rakesh emphasized that Micron is one of the few companies positioned to deliver both volume growth and margin expansion in this environment.\u201d \u3010MarketWatch\u3011\n\nUBS (Timothy Arcuri) \u2013 PT $185\n\n\u201cUBS analyst Timothy Arcuri raised Micron\u2019s price target to $185 and reiterated a Buy rating. Arcuri pointed to confidence in DRAM and HBM supply tightness and sustained AI-related growth as the core reasons for the higher target. He noted that Micron\u2019s technology roadmap has been executing well and that the company is positioned to capture outsized share of the high-performance memory demand wave driven by Nvidia, AMD, and hyperscalers.\u201d \u3010PriceTargets.com\u3011\n\nSusquehanna \u2013 PT $200\n\n\u201cSusquehanna Financial upgraded its Micron target to $200, keeping a Positive rating. Analysts cited tightening DRAM and NAND supply, improving average selling prices across memory, and accelerating AI adoption as reasons to expect Micron\u2019s earnings power to surprise to the upside. The firm believes current Street estimates remain too low given the structural tailwinds in AI-centric workloads.\u201d \u3010PriceTargets.com\u3011\n\nJPMorgan (Harlan Sur) \u2013 PT $185\n\n\u201cJPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur raised Micron\u2019s price target to $185 from $160 and kept an Overweight rating. Sur highlighted upside to revenue, gross margin, and earnings in the near term, driven by better-than-expected pricing across multiple end-markets including AI data centers, smartphones, and personal computers. He said the company is likely to announce November-quarter guidance that comes in solidly ahead of consensus expectations. JPMorgan believes Micron\u2019s HBM3E ramp and DRAM cost reductions are ahead of schedule, which will further support earnings acceleration.\u201d \u3010Benzinga\u3011\n\nRosenblatt Securities (Kevin Cassidy) \u2013 PT $200\n\n\u201cRosenblatt Securities analyst Kevin Cassidy reaffirmed a Buy rating on Micron and boosted the firm\u2019s target to $200. Cassidy wrote that Micron could report a modest beat to its preannounced results, but the real story will be the outlook. He expects Micron\u2019s November-quarter guidance may come in much higher than consensus estimates of $11.8 billion in revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $3.00. Cassidy emphasized that constrained DRAM and NAND Flash wafer supply through at least 2026, alongside accelerating demand from AI workloads, positions Micron for outsized profitability.\u201d \u3010Benzinga\u3011\n\nZacks Investment Research \u2013 Avg PT $155.59 (Range $75\u2013$200)\n\n\u201cZacks recently upgraded Micron from Hold to Strong Buy, giving the stock a Zacks Rank #1. Their analysts cite accelerating demand for DRAM and NAND, stronger-than-expected revenue in AI/data center markets, and consistent earnings surprises as the drivers. Zacks\u2019 consensus 12-month price target from ~34 analysts is $155.59, with estimates ranging from as low as $75 to as high as $200. They highlight Micron\u2019s strong Growth and Momentum scores, though its Value score is weaker given the higher multiples.\u201d \u3010Zacks / MarketBeat\u3011\n\nMicron Management Quotes & Context\n\n\u201cMicron\u2019s strong competitive position and solid execution delivered record revenue in fiscal Q3, with revenue, gross margin and EPS all exceeding the high end of our guidance ranges.\u201d \u2014 Sanjay Mehrotra, CEO.  \ufffc\n\n\u201cData center revenue more than doubled year over year and reached a record level, and consumer-oriented markets had strong sequential growth.\u201d \u2014 Mehrotra.  \ufffc\n\t\n\u201cWe generated substantial free cash flow in the quarter, even as we continue to make strategic investments critical to sustain long term growth.\u201d \u2014 Mehrotra.  \ufffc\n\t\n\u201cMicron delivered record revenue in fiscal Q3, driven by all-time-high DRAM revenue including nearly 50% sequential growth in HBM revenue.\u201d \u2014 Mehrotra.  \ufffc\n\n\u201cWe are on track to deliver record revenue with solid profitability and free cash flow in fiscal 2025, while we invest to build on our leadership to address growing AI-driven memory demand.\u201d \u2014 Mehrotra.  \ufffc\n\n\u201cFiscal Q3 DRAM revenue was $7.1 billion, up 51% year over year, and represented 76% of total revenue. Sequentially, DRAM revenue increased 15%, with bit shipments increasing over 20% and prices decreasing in the low single-digit percentage range, primarily due to a higher consumer-oriented revenue mix.\u201d \u2014 Mark Murphy, CFO.  \ufffc\n\n\u201cNAND revenue was $2.2 billion \u2026 Sequentially, NAND revenue increased 16%, with bit shipments increasing in the mid-20s percentage range and prices decreasing in the high single-digit percentage range.\u201d \u2014 Murphy.  \ufffc\n\n\u201cGross margin \u2026 was above the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to better prices for both DRAM and NAND, partially offset by a higher consumer-oriented mix.\u201d \u2014 CFO Murphy.  \ufffc\n\t\n\u201cEnding inventory for fiscal Q3 was $8.7 billion, or 139 days. Inventory was down $280 million sequentially, and inventory days were down 19 days sequentially, driven by strong sequential bit shipment growth in both DRAM and NAND.\u201d \u2014 Murphy.  \ufffc\n\t\nGuidance for Q4:\n\u201cWe expect revenue of $10.7 billion \u00b1 $300 million; gross margin non-GAAP of ~42% \u00b1 1%; operating expenses approx $1.2 billion \u00b1 $20 million; non-GAAP EPS of ~$2.50 \u00b1 $0.15 per share.\u201d \u2014 Micron management.  \ufffc\n\n\u201cWith another quarter of shipment growth forecasted in fiscal Q4, we expect to exit fiscal 2025 with tight DRAM inventories, significantly reduced NAND inventories and overall company DIO near our target levels. With low inventories on hand and a constructive demand environment, we will continue to focus on improving pricing and further strengthening our product mix.\u201d \u2014 Management.  \ufffc\n\nSource: https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/micron-technology-inc-nasdaqmu-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript-1559366/ \n\nTLDR\n\nBest Case (Bullish)\n\nRevenue: ~$11.2B+ (above top of guidance)\n\nEPS: $2.90+ (beats revised $2.85 guide)\n\nGross Margin: 45%+ (tight supply + strong DRAM/HBM pricing)\n\nGuidance: Raised again for FY2026, pointing to sustained AI/cloud demand\n\t\nStock Impact: Could rally +20\u201330%, pushing toward $180\u2013$200 as analysts hike targets\n\nWorst Case (Bearish)\n\nRevenue: < $11.0B (below guide midpoint)\n\nEPS: < $2.70 (miss vs Street ~$2.78\u2013$2.85)\n\nMargins: Slip toward 42\u201343% (pricing softness, higher costs)\n\nGuidance: Conservative, signaling slower demand or inventory concerns\n\nStock Impact: Could drop \u221210\u201325%, retracing toward $120\u2013$130\n\nThe biggest risk I see is the cyclical narrative but given the demand this year and how we are seeing AI and data centers scaling up, I think we have reached a point where the market transitions from cyclical to more secular. \n\nRight now PE is ~24-25 with the drop but if EPS expectation is hit $10-12 for FY 2026, and PE drops to 18-20 we are still looking at $200+ price target. I believe $175-185 is a lower range.\n\nOf course this all depends on how Micron Management forward guidance looks but I think we are in for a surprise. \n\nGood luck \ud83d\ude4f",

I was buying calls during the pullback the last few months and sold them when it ripped to 150 at 140% gain. The RSI was super high when it hit 170 (over 85\u203c\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0f), but has cooled slightly. This is exactly what happened last ER tho, the stock ripped into the report and then topped out the second the numbers hit the tape, even tho it was a fantastic quarter. I\u2019m personally waiting to see what happens to get back into this company. The valuation remains exceptionally cheap relatively to the rest of the AI market, I can see this thing hitting like 300-400 in the next few years if it\u2019s still truly the early days of the AI buildout."

It\u2019s uniquely positioned and while Samsung is a competitor they still bought Micron memory for their Galaxy S25 rather use their own. So that just pulled me in more. And then with the thought process I laid out with their customer base and the demand they have, I don\u2019t see domestic companies opting for Samsung as the logistics is easier. Micron also sends out their specialist to their clients to help them with their needs. I just don\u2019t see how Samsung will penetrate the U.S. AI and Datacenter space as heavily as Micron. Even if they have better pricing potentially with the tarrifs in play it\u2019ll be a harder execution is my thinking. If Micron and Samsung have same pricing but Micron has custom solutions for every client and they can send specialist out to analyze needs and demand sounds like a better fit domestically than having international powerhouse fly in. Nvidia is different with Samsung as they outsource their fabs so they order what works best pricing wise but for the other companies that are set to build data centers for AI I don\u2019t see why they\u2019d settle for Samsung over Micron in the long run. Building data centers is a lot of capex and time matters. Domestic = speed vs international is my thought process.\n\nOther plays nothing crazy yet but I will share more in the future if I have anything with high conviction haha."

CHIPS Act & global incentives may reduce capex burden more than expected, boosting FCF.\n\nValuation re-rating. Market still treats Micron as a cyclical memory name. A shift toward \u201cAI infrastructure play\u201d could justify higher multiples.\n\nIf even a couple of these materialize, Micron could support the more aggressive $190\u2013200 PTs rather than just hanging around the $160s. I don\u2019t think we will see a retrace with the EPS expectation for Q4 being ~$2.80 because this brings TTM to $8 but may push FY 2026 to $12 range. Lot of potential upside which makes forward PE closer to 20 based on TTM of $8 but 7.4 with a $12 projected EPS in 2026 with current prices.\n\nFor 2026\n\n$8 EPS with 18-20 PE = $144-160 (but I doubt $8 is the expectation for 2026) \n\n$10 EPS with 18-20 PE = $180-200\n\n$12 EPS with 18-20 PE = $216-$240 \n\nJust my thoughts.\n\nBut maybe I am just a regard \ud83d\ude02"

If EPS is good and forward guidance for 2026 looks good, forward PE will drop to high 10s at best 20. That's super attractive for a company that is in the AI market and is pivotal to the development of data centers and GPUS. The debt balance isn't as bad either because their FCF is strong and they make a ton of interest on their cash to cover their debt load."

Since they already sold out their 2025 supply end of Q3, it makes me wonder how much they have sold 2026 supply and also development with HBM. They\u2019re also spending $100 billion expanding their fabs and expansion plans so I think it just comes down to how they play with that. But this EPS is the biggest we\u2019ve seen so far which is why I\u2019m more bullish than previous earning calls.\n\nIf they can demonstrate that we\u2019re moving away from cyclical to more secular I think that\u2019s a huge potential catalyst. I believe we\u2019re transitioning into secular and that\u2019s something that isn\u2019t really priced in."

If AI and data centers are going to ramp up, and Micron HBM4 is solid, I can see they taking the market domestically especially if pricing is similar and on par with S Koreas Samsung and SK Hynix."

Discovery,\" Puck's Dylan Byers has followed up to reveal that \"a well-placed Hollywood source called to suggest \\[...\\] that Netflix was also considering a bid for David Zaslav's \\[WBD CEO and president\\] assets.\"\n\n>Byers acknowledges that this scenario was once \"implausible,\" but that \"Ellison's seemingly limitless cash and ambition have accelerated Hollywood's consolidation process, and his decision to bid for all of WBD now\u2014in an attempt to preempt potential rivals\u2014is forcing nearly everyone to dust off their models.\"\n\n>These potential bids are coming after Warner Bros.' historic summer with a streak of successful movies at the box office. However, Puck reports that Steven Cahall of Wells Fargo \"does not expect WBD stock price to move much beyond $19 a share\" and that \"neither Apple nor Amazon will go for all of WBD.\"\n\n>Thinking along the lines that Netflix would be interested only in Warner Bros.' studio and streaming operations, Byers says: \"\\[...\\] as I discussed on Sunday, Zaz would need to convince his board and WBD shareholders that there would be more value coming from the split than from the Ellisons\u2014that two in the bush is worth more than a bird in hand.\"\n\n>As far as what Paramount's possibly buying Warner Bros. means, the merging of two of Hollywood's oldest studios could result in a powerful new institution in the industry. Ellison seemingly wants to go all in on this idea, as his goal is to buy all of Warner Bros.' assets, including games, comics, and more. Netflix's offer might mean splitting up parts of the company.\n\nTL:DR - they probably want to spin-off parts of WBD which may be a tougher sell to their shareholders than a huge bag of $ from the Ellisons for the whole thing.\n\nSeems like Netflix is trying to take a final stab at grabbing part of WBD before they sell to PSKY. Ellisons offered $22-24/share, think some analysts were calling 21/share bullish so my take away is that the Ellisons seem likely to get this done.",

Just create a bunch of gacha games with their IP and diversify there. \n\nPeople seem to forget that video games are the biggest entertainment sector. They\u2019re bigger than the film, television and music industry combined. \n\nNetflix should expand here into a new market instead of their core business. Realistically how many more subs can they get with this merger. \n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s probably people who are double dipping and have WBD and Netflix both. \n\nI just think there\u2019s better ways to use that money than spend billions on WBD imo."

Discovery,*\"\u00a0[*Puck*](https://puck.news/newsletter_content/skybros-deal-math-kimmels-suspension-tiktoks-backroom-deal/)'s Dylan Byers has followed up to reveal that\u00a0\"*a well-placed Hollywood source called to suggest \\[...\\] that Netflix was also considering a bid for David Zaslav's \\[WBD CEO and president\\] assets.*\"\n\n>Byers acknowledges that this scenario was once \"*implausible,*\" but that\u00a0\"*Ellison's seemingly limitless cash and ambition have accelerated Hollywood's consolidation process,\u00a0and his decision to bid for all of WBD now\u2014in an attempt to preempt potential rivals\u2014is forcing nearly everyone to dust off their models.*\"\n\n>These potential bids are coming after\u00a0[Warner Bros.' historic summer with a streak](https://screenrant.com/one-battle-after-another-warner-bros-40-million-opening-streak/)\u00a0of successful movies at the box office. However, Puck reports that\u00a0Steven Cahall of Wells Fargo \"*does not expect WBD stock price to move much beyond $19 a share*\" and that \"*neither Apple nor Amazon will go for all of WBD.*\"\n\n>Thinking along the lines that\u00a0Netflix would be interested only in Warner Bros.' studio and streaming operations,\u00a0Byers says: \"*\\[...\\] as I discussed on Sunday,\u00a0Zaz would need to convince his board and WBD shareholders that there would be more value coming from the split\u00a0than from the Ellisons\u2014that two in the bush is worth more than a bird in hand.*\"\n\n>As far as\u00a0[what Paramount's possibly buying Warner Bros. means](https://screenrant.com/paramount-warner-bros-merger-hollywood/), the merging of two of Hollywood's oldest studios could result in a powerful new institution in the industry.\u00a0Ellison seemingly wants to go all in on this idea, as his goal is to buy all of Warner Bros.' assets, including games, comics, and more. Netflix's offer might mean splitting up parts of the company.\n\nTL:DR - they probably want to spin-off parts of WBD which may be a tougher sell to their shareholders than a huge bag of $ from the Ellisons for the whole thing.\n\nSeems like Netflix is trying to take a final stab at grabbing part of WBD before they sell to PSKY. Ellisons offered $22-24/share, think some analysts were calling 21/share bullish so my take away is that the Ellisons seem likely to get this done."

Think about bottled water companies, there are little chances to change massively from one year to another.\n\n- you have a very high volatility stock where you can sells calls at a high premium.

For example, say the strike price is $100 and the stock is now at $120 and your option expires at the end of the week.  You get $100 per share if you do nothing.\n\nYou might be able to roll it one week in the future and earn $1 per share for the privilege, which works out to $100 per option.  I've done this recently.  Sure, the stock could go up higher in that week, but you are earning a guaranteed 1% for the week.  That's 52% annualized.  Not a bad return for one week. \n\nThe worst case is that the stock goes under $100 in the week and you keep the premium and don't have to sell the stock."

It's not a bad call unless you think you can do better over the next 6 months in something else.  You could pick a later strike too.  1/27 gives you 140C.  That would give you another big increase in return all things staying the same.  Here you would lock yourself in for another $20k on 3 contracts.  Sure, your money is tied up but that is still an amazing return.\n\nIt really depends on how bullish you are on OKLO.  If you think it's going 200+, getting your shares called away and buying back in could be the play.  300?  Absolutely.  Then again, it can always drop as fast, or faster, than it climbed."

With RSI currently at 51, netflix is  not technically  oversold, but below 50, I will look at puts one week out.  It is a lot of margin required (but not used or borrowed)  It is a great earnings based company that is a leader in its sector. It is expensive on a PE basis, which increases risk of volatility.  It is widely owned by institutions. RSI is not all that reliable, but is helpful\n\n2  for instance , rhis morning it is indicating 1221, down six dolllars.  If it stays here on opening, I would expect to be able to sell a 1200 9/26 put for around $900 I am commited to buy the stock if it is below 1200 on friday this week, It has good support at 1200.  (see one month chart)\n\n3,  If it gets put on me at 1200 my cost basis is 1191. If it does not (it stays above 1200m the put expires, I am golden)) Now an  in the money call can be sold for one week at about 1800.   You can't be afraid to exit at a profit.  Just keep looking at your companies,  you will recognize what news or earnings often does to the price.  That puts me at a cost basis of 1173.  Say the stock Friday is at 1180.  I can buy back that put for 11 or 12 (500 profit) and sell a new 1180 for another 1800. now my cost basis is 1186.  I am definately in the drivers seat.\n\nThings go wrong.  Low volume can mask a good buy.  High volume can indicate a wait and see. Do paper trades for a bit."

Not until I get to my retirement goal. \n\nLoaded OPEN heavy under a dollar while being laughed at by many, AST, HIMS, HOOD, SOFI, and a few others helped contribute but it\u2019s been a relatively consistent grind higher since the tariff dump in April. I did take some profits from OPEN (original position in my previous post) still expect good things from these holdings overall regardless of a correction in the coming months.\n\nSetup my ROTH last month with $7k and interested to see how much I can swing this with concentrated bets. Recently sold the SNAP LEAPS I picked up a few weeks ago, and got flamed by many for suggesting, for a 50% gain. $PATH has bottomed IMO and should be a beneficiary of agentic AI over the next couple years with what look to be improving fundamentals. LEAPS here looked good to me so I loaded.\n\nBest of luck out there you fuggin regards \n\n\u201cToday you are You, that is truer than true. There is no one alive who is Youer than You\u201d\n",

The contract also promises new data center campuses promised in several states. CRWV acquired Core Scientific essentially giving them access to 1.3 GW of gross power and 1 GW for future expansion. I believe it is in Oracles best interest to involve, or at least co involve Coreweave in this seeing as how they can also gain access to a large amount of compute for the cloud contract (NVDA has a huge stake and massive interest in seeing CRWV succeed, along with providing them with their top of the line GPUS) and also the raw power needed to power this entire thing. Again this is just speculation. Also idk why bring up GLXY as if CRWV would just make one partnership and then reject anymore business. We'll have to see what happens."

Why would ORCL work with a competitor? Hypothetically if they did partner up, CRWV would be at the will of ORCL as they own all the hardware, they wouldn\u2019t be able to manage multiple clients from their data center or control the gpu\u2019s, software, or do any upgrades at all.\n\nSo I\u2019m a little confused what type of deal you think they\u2019d make here"

Only way you could do this well is if you have >500k portfolio at the minimum and you dropped 1-5% onto this and forgot about it.\n\n\nThats why, unironically, dropping couple Gs (<5k) on leaps are the best. Accept the 'loss' the moment you buy it and just rage hold it. Those make me the best gains (% speaking at least).\n\n\nTheres always a person who did nothing but held and won absolutely nothing (imagine buying intel and holding it for 10 years), so dont feel too beat up by this.\n\nMy mom did exactly that, aside from VOO and some bonds. Who would've known?"

As with any such ETF, top holdings get disproportionately more inflows than the rest, but add up to \\~30% of total holdings. In other words, you can make your own version of \"GDX\" that doesn't have the ballast. But that requires some work. The payoff is the difference between 10x and 2x - in time (within a couple of years), and with Trump's robot in charge of Fed, they will all go up, but some 10x, some 2x. If we get ZIRP and QE again, it would be more like 100x and 20x - once the passive flows and the gamma flows (market makers' hedges for \\~$1T in call options) do to gold miners what they did to Nvidia and Palantir in 3 years. That is by far the largest common factor in this: passive and gamma flows. But there are good gold miners (Agnico), and there are other gold miners - there is no reason to have a bag of \"others\" in GDX, if you can have 10 good ones."

These don't get disproportional ETF inflow due to low percentage in holdings.\n\nAgnico is the best gold mining company overall (means the least internal flaws in it), and #2 at GDX holdings - it benefits from both kinds of \"better\". My opinion is there will be a trillion-cap gold miner within \\~five years, due to combined effects of dollar devaluation, inelastic bid for gold, gold miners margins going to stupid levels, passive flows and gamma flows into \"gold\" (same as \"AI\" now), and Agnico is my primary suspect for that role. There might be several of them, I am just not sure about others (Newmont, Barrick)."

This is an industry that historically is about as slow, plodding growth as you could imagine, but data center (especially AI) growth has caused utilities and RTOs to completely revise their projection models and CAPEX spending.\n\nIf you look in like 2019 or 2020, what utilities projected in terms of electricity demand by 2030, it is so much less than what they\u2019re projecting now. We need tons more generation, transmission, distribution, storage\u2026 literally everything."

They are partnering with OPEN and received $71 million dollars from that partnership last year.\u00a0\n\n\nThis number is huge. If OPEN can double or triple those numbers on a good year for housing, we are going to see a rapid appreciation to $17 and then $32. What's important for OPEN to focus on is ripping the bandaid off and going all in on replacing real estate agents. Without working tech, in the AI Era, this company is failed.

But if you are correct and it falls below your cost basis and strike, you profit more. It's ultimately no different than any other option or share purchase, you're betting on it rising or falling to a certain number or beyond it."

If you learn about intrinsic / extrinsic value of an option you will understand better the flexibility of buying ITM, ATM, OTM.  Theta decay is a curve.  Learn about different DTE and how that affects theta decay.  LEAPS are almost like buying the stock, but for much less capital expense.  UNH @ $300 per share... I bought $250 strike call for 1 year out.  I pay intrinsic value, plus the theta decay.  $80 / share instead... understand now? 8k of capital has 3k profit already,  If I bought 8k of shares... I would have much less profit... understand?  I risk less capital, but make more profit.  This option is already ITM, it is behaving like a share of the company.  I have 100 shares instead of 26.

Plus, I might be wrong here, percent change between strike price appear to be uniform. Therefore, isnt it a better idea to buy option that cheaper so we can get more contract for the dollar and have much bigger profit?

    "text": "Duolingo DD\n\u00a0Dear, Ladies, gentleman and degenerate market regards\n\nI\u2019ve been doing a deep dive into one particular public company called Duolingo. You might be saying \u201cwtf the language learning app?\u201d. Yes correct, that app with the green owl. A company can be selling dog food for all I care, but if the numbers and the narrative are good, I'm buying. That being said, Duolingo ($DUOL) is slowly presenting an amazing opportunity as the stock price continues to fall. Opportunities like this is how life changing wealth is made. When everyone is betting on the downfall, you take the other side of that trade and bet against them all. The risk to reward ratio on this is too good to ignore.\n\nWould also like to mention, if you\u2019re an ape who has been buying into the hype of palantir with a disgusting 600 PE ratio, so high that you might as well buy your local pizza shop thats makes 100k a year for 50 million, then duolingo should not be a problem for you to take a chance on.\n\n**The Narrative**\n\nThe bubble has officially popped on Duolingo due to rising fears of competitors entering the market. The two main competitors as of right now are OPENAI, and the tech giant GOOGLE. People are discovering through OpenAi that you can create your own language learning game and are rumoring that people will no longer need duolingo. Google had also announced that they will be entering the language learning app space with google translator utilizing ai for live language conversion. Duolingo did also damage their PR by announcing they would be utilizing AI as well, which the public did not take lightly as they misunderstood it for replacing their employees with AI. Users also had reason to believe that AI will create poor quality content in comparison to having humans manually make the courses which may be true; however, if other companies are in the race utilizing AI for language learning, then Duolingo must compete. Those 3 narratives were enough to pop the bubble of duolingo as it has fallen from $542 to $282 as of today. Can the stock fall further? Yes it can, but it's one of those scenarios where you want it to.\n\nThe P/E ratio of Duolingo was over 300 at its peak on May 15th 2025. Yes the company was way overvalued at the time for a growth company, (a fair valuation for growth companies range between (40-80) however the company is consistently beating earnings expectations and their free cash flow continues to rise higher and higher. Today that P/E ratio has dropped to 122 and its price to sales ratio has dropped to 15:1. Yes those numbers still do seem high, but\u00a0\n\nas their free cash flow continues to rise, that P/E ratio will drop into fair valuations. Understand that this company is growing on average 40% year over year. For those who don't understand, markets are always forward looking. The institutions and retail investors who are buying into this company are betting on the fact that the over valuation numbers will drop as they consistently report good earnings, revenue and forward guidance.\n\n**The Bull Thesis**\n\nSo before being able to predict the future, you first need to look into the past where history doesn't always repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme. Take a look at the success of Netflix. Even when Amazon, Apple, Disney and Google (youtube) entered the space of video streaming, people thought Netflix would be in serious trouble. In 2011, Amazon announced that they would offer Amazon prime video for free with their subscription; while at the same time Netflix decided to increase their prices by 60%.\u00a0\n\nCustomers were furious and Netflix lost over 800 000 subscribers in 1 quarter. This resulted in their Free cash flow dropping from 59 million in quarter 2 of 2011, to 15 million in quarter 3 of 2011. Eventually their free cash flow did fall into the negatives and recovered in 2013 (you can see how the stock follows that on the charts).\n\n**The Moat**\n\nThere is no moat. Just branding. \u201cHow is this bullish?\u201d Well lets think, what\u2019s Spotify's moat? What about Netflix? Literally just branding is the moat, so people who think duolingo\u2019s demise is due to a lack of a business moat are delusional. It\u2019s like saying in the year 2000, \u201cwhy would anyone buy into amazon when anyone can make a website and sell books?\u201d fucking regards.\u00a0\n\n**User Experience**\n\nWhen you look at music streaming services, spotify ($SPOT) was the first to the game publicly. Eventually, Apple, Google (youtube), Amazon and about 20 other music streaming platforms nobody gives a fuck about had entered the game. Yet to this day, spotify is what\u2019s most popular among them all taking 36% of the music streaming market. Why? User experience is the answer. The spotify platform itself is what carries them and separates them from the rest for both artists and customers.\u00a0\n\n**The Brand**\n\nThe infamous green owl logo is famous across the world. Duolingo is a world wide icon for language learning. When people hear that \u201cding\\* sound completing a duolingo game, everyone knows instantly that it's duolingo. When people ask about learning another language, they instantly point people in the direction of duolingo. It's literally the rank #13 app on the app store for apple and on the front page of \u201cessential apps.\u201d\n\n\tWhen people talk to each other about music they ask \u201cwhat's you\u2019re spotify?\u201d Nobody asks whats your \u201capple music, amazon music or youtube music\u201d\n\n\tWhen your wife\u2019s boyfriend is asking her to come over and watch a movie, he says \u201cnetflix and chill\u201d NOT \u201camazon prime, disney, or apple tv and chill?\u201d the fuck?\n\nI'm listing these examples, because they all have a subscription business model just like duolingo. That being said, duolingo\u2019s subscription model is actually better than theirs.\n\n**Business Model**\n\nAd revenue and subscriptions, that's it. People pay a yearly subscription for their ability to learn new languages which has been proven to be more effective and enjoyable than any other method through gamification. You got kids who are using this damn app in school, recommended by their teachers and you have parents buying it for their kids. Lets not forget that this company is now going to expand out of just language learning as they have included learning subjects like music, math and chess.\u00a0\n\nWait? Chess? Wtf?\u00a0\n\nYes that's exactly what I'm thinking, but if you look beyond that, Duolingo is expanding to hit the whole education market. Why pay for chess lessons from elsewhere when you can get it on duolingo with 100+ additional learning courses. Ideally, duolingo is expanding into a whole education platform, more directed towards the youth for everything. I wouldn't be surprised if they included courses like science, finance, health etc\u2026\n\n\tThey have utilized AI in addition to help the teachers/course makers create new courses at a very accelerated pace. Their first 100 courses took them 12 years. Now with AI, they are generating 153 new courses in 1 year.\n\n\tThere is NO FRICTION.\n\n* No governments/regulations trying to stop this\n* No maintenance on their assets (courses)\n* No real competition in user experience\n\nAll they have to do is create a great product (a course), add it into their catalog of other courses that comes with the subscription. The more they add, the more incentive there is to go with duolingo instead of buying learning programs elsewhere.\n\n**The Bear Thesis**\n\nGo fuck yourself?\n\nOn a serious note, looking at Google live translation app which they offer for free; it does seem to be very reliable, but strictly for translating. They claim to be offering language learning practice tools on their google translate app which would be free. Not to mention, there are already over 1 billion downloads of google translate. Comparing it to Duolingo, yes both of them are free, however; google has not announced whether they would\u00a0 put a pay wall behind learning/using their practice tool. However what google is missing in comparison to Duolingo secret formula of success would be gamification.\u00a0\n\nIf the companies continues to show slower growth, or continues to show a decline in active user for the few quarters; well then, we\u2019re fucked. But as of right now, the decline in free cash flow from last quarter to this isn\u2019t \"catastrophic,\" but rather a typical overreaction to the narrative.\u00a0\n\n**External Risks**\n\nRising interest rates. Lets be real, trump is calling for lower interest rates but obviously Jerome Powell doesn't want to follow through with it. In the long term event that they can\u2019t afford to lower rates but rather might\u00a0 increase rates; the broad market does face the risk of a downturn just like in 2022-2023, which of course would most likely add more downward pressure to the stock and market as a whole.\n\nAnother external risk that may present itself is a massive bull market in gold, and extreme volatility in government bond markets, more specifically the 10 year yield bonds. For those who don't understand, a massive bull market in gold has always signaled warning signs that something is about to break in the financial system, because gold has always been considered the safe haven asset. Extreme volatility in bond markets signal panic when the yields spread too far apart from the benchmark rate of the federal reserve, which stands at 4.25 as of right now.\n\nCash from Operations\n\n2025(Q2) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2025(Q1) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2024(Q4) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2024(Q3)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (2024)Q2 \u00a0 \u00a0 2024(Q1)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2023(Q4)\n\n||\n||\n|90.675M|105.631M|83.344M|56.267M|62.388M|83.514M|49.214M||\n\nCapital expenditures\n\n||\n||\n|\\-4.351M|\\-2.619M|\\-2.44M|\\-5.023M|\\-8.656M|\\-5.021M|\\-4.184M|\n\nFree cash flow = cash from operations - capital expenditures.\n\nNotice how their free cash flow keeps on rising? Notice how free cash flow has dropped in Q2 compared to Q1 of 2025? That small decline in free cash flow, paired with the narrative of the company's demise in the future has resulted in a crash from $542 to $282. Let me tell you right now, if this company reports an increase in free cash flow in the next few earnings calls; Not only can the narrative change from negative to positive, this stock can very well turn around and go bullish very fast.\u00a0\n\n**The Numbers (QUARTER OVER QUARTER) (2024/2025)**\n\n**Shares outstanding**: 45.6 million (Plenty of room for future stock splits)\n\n**Beta(TTM)**: 1.7 (over the past trailing twelve months, the company moves 1.7x more volatile than the Nasdaq)\n\n**Revenue growth QoQ**: 41%\n\n**Subscription growth QoQ**: 46%\u00a0\n\n**Free Cash flow growth QoQ**: 61%\n\n||\n||\n|**(in millions)**|**Q2 2024**|**Q2 2025**|**YoY**|\n|**User Metrics**||||\n|Monthly active users (MAUs)|103.6|128.3|**24%**|\n|Daily active users (DAUs)|34.1|47.7|**40%**|\n|Paid subscribers (period end)|8.0|10.9|**37%**|\n|**Operating Metrics**||||\n|Subscription bookings|$156.5|$227.3|**45%**|\n|Total bookings|$190.1|$268.0|41%|\n|**GAAP Financial Measures**||||\n|Revenues|$178.3|$252.3|**41%**|\n|Subscription revenues|$143.9|$210.7|**46%**|\n|Gross profit|$131.0|$182.6|39%|\n|Gross margin (%)|73.4%|72.4%|\\~(1) pts|\n|Net income|$24.4|$44.8|84%|\n|Net cash from operating activities|$62.4|$90.7|45%|\n|**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**||||\n|Adjusted EBITDA|$48.1|$78.7|64%|\n|Adjusted EBITDA margin|27.0%|31.2%|\\~4 pts|\n|Free cash flow|$53.7|$86.3|**61%**|\n|Free cash flow margin|30.1%|34.2%|\\~4 pts|\n\nThe stock price of Duolingo hovering at $270 is basically assuming the company\u2019s growth over the next 5 years would only be at about 25%. If you take a look at the numbers above, the only thing that's under 25% are the monthly active users. The Company is projecting on its forward guidance about 35% YoY growth; which means the stock price is falling towards undervalued territory. The company has been growing at about 45% annually over the past 5 years, so yes a 35% growth on forward guidance does signal a decline in growth. But if you want to take the contrarian approach to the company, believing that AI will accelerate the growth of the company and Google means fuck all; this would be an amazing buying opportunity.\u00a0\n\nP.S -This is not financial advice, I'm not a financial advisor. This is just my opinion on my projections of this company's stock price. If you buy high, panic, then sell low, too bad, sucks for you. Would recommend buying and holding the stock as we don't know how long this negative narrative will play out. (maybe **WRITING** covered calls OTM for a passive income) If you're a regard and you choose to gamble your life savings **Buying** OTM call options, good luck.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8jy1qbkig5qf1.png?width=1148&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa02e88ce375e98ba727a56a9753288d18a20ce0\n\n  \n",

Competing giants could redigitize and reencode their content for internet streaming and pay very expensive rates for on demand bandwidth throttling with ISPs in an age long before that\u2019s been cost-down but they\u2019d only be able to offer their own content, no network of existing partners with existing subscriber base and reliable revenue share forecasts."

        "text": "I mean, since u posted a literal chatgpt answer and reworded it a bit, ill just post one too...? \n\n Netflix 2011: The Moat of Momentum\n\nIn 2011, Netflix\u2019s competitive edge didn\u2019t come from original content \u2014 that would arrive years later \u2014 but from its **massive licensed library** and **subscriber infrastructure**. While media giants still viewed streaming as experimental, Netflix had already aggregated content through broad licensing agreements, creating a one-stop destination for viewers.\n\nCompetitors couldn\u2019t simply replicate this advantage overnight. To build a rival service, a studio could digitize and re-encode its own catalog for internet delivery, but the result would be a narrow, single-studio offering. Worse, the technical costs of on-demand bandwidth in the early 2010s were prohibitively high, making the economics unattractive without an existing subscriber base. Netflix had that base \u2014 paying users, predictable revenue, and working distribution relationships with ISPs.\n\nThis combination of **content scale, infrastructure, and early-mover subscriber loyalty** gave Netflix a moat that delayed serious competition until deep-pocketed rivals like Disney and Amazon eventually committed billions to catch up.\n\n# Duolingo Today: A Parallel Challenge\n\nDuolingo in 2025 finds itself in a situation that echoes Netflix\u2019s 2011 moat. It may not own all the \u201ccontent\u201d (languages are universal), but it has something equally defensible:\n\n* A **massive user base** built through years of gamified learning.\n* A **global brand** synonymous with fun, accessible language learning.\n* **Data and AI infrastructure** to personalize lessons at scale.\n* Deep relationships with learners (and even institutions, through the Duolingo English Test).\n\nLive translation apps are like the \u201cmedia giants\u201d of Netflix\u2019s era: they have technical capability and resources, but lack a comparable **network effect**. They can offer instant utility \u2014 like a studio streaming only its own shows in 2011 \u2014 but they don\u2019t yet provide the structured, addictive learning experience Duolingo has refined.\n\nThe risk, of course, is that just as Disney+ eventually disrupted Netflix by combining vast content ownership with streaming scale, big tech platforms (Apple, Google, Meta) could erode Duolingo\u2019s moat by embedding **translation + learning** into everyday devices.\n\n# The Takeaway\n\nNetflix survived and thrived because it **pivoted into original content** before competitors could commoditize its model. Duolingo faces a similar inflection point: it must **go beyond basic lessons** into immersive learning, culture, and hybrid translation-learning experiences before live translation becomes \u201cgood enough\u201d for casual users.\n\nIts early start, brand loyalty, and data advantage are real moats \u2014 but, as Netflix\u2019s story shows, moats only hold if you keep deepening them before rivals catch up."

        "text": "The first problem with QC is TAM, which is tiny. Scammy CEOs from IONQ and QBTS will deliberately insinuate that the quantum computing is the next thing for the current datacentres. QC doesn't do general compute, e.g. it cannot load a word document and make changes to it. It cannot calculate computer graphics, it cannot do much at all. It can in theory run some very specific algorithms at a much higher speed (none of the current machines are even close to running anything). \n\nSo you can imagine immediately that this is not replacing Intel CPUs or anything. If you had some quantum machines you could sell a few of them to NSA and others for cracking current asymmetric encryption algorithms. So total revenue for the whole industry would be in single digit billions at most. The encryption thing would be patched pretty quickly by software updates to use lattice based crypto that is QC resistant. \n\nAnyway first you have a tiny TAM, then that TAM gets split into a bunch of hopefuls. You've got MSFT, IBM, GOOGLE, then you've got a bunch of smaller PRIVATE companies, and then you've got these publicly traded ones QBTS, QUBT, RGTI, IONQ. \n\nAs you can see, now you are investing in fewer than half of the quantum players in hopes of one of those \"winning\" and taking most of a very small TAM, beating out players like google and msft. Also nearly every company uses a different approach with different quantum gate type, so there's not gonna be \"fast follow\" from secondary players if one of these has a breakthrough.\n\nSo already you cannot justify multibillion dollar evaluations. Then you have to consider that it's at least 5 years before anyone has anything approaching a quantum computer that can run real apps. You'd need at least a 1000x in qubits and at least 1000000x drop in error rate. Qbits randomly flipping during program runtime = failure.\n\nThen you have to consider each player:\n\n\\- RGTI is pretty honest, CEO tells you straight up they don't have anything for the next 7 years and to not expect any revenue. They are way behind the private players and labs at IBM and Googl. Somehow worth 10B.  \n\\- IONQ has a scumbag CEO who constantly lies about what they will deliver and what they will do. He namedrops Nvidia like 50x in 15 minutes each time he's on a stage. He said that they will overtake Nvidia 2027 (how is he allowed to say shit like that?) which is laughable. The actual business is that they burn money, but with stock price pumping they keep diluting and doing acquisitions. Gonna have tons of goodwill on balance sheet end of the year. Those acquisitions add revenue (even though small compared to the price paid), so they can claim rev growth 50% YoY or whatever. Retards lap it up, firm dilutes again, acquires another quantum satelite company for 1B or whatever. Rinse and repeat.  \n\\- QBTS doesn't have a classical QC but just a quantum annealer, supposedly for optimization problems. The scam is that they sell \"hybrid\" systems: QC with a normal computer attached to their shit. They have been selling for years, so not a future play, yet no real revenue. It is not possible to determine how much of work classical computer part of the system does and how much quantum does. It doesn't demonstrate any real speedup and former employees allege it's all just for show.  \n\\- QUBT: Literally a company with quantum in the name, now worth like 6B. Had 30k revenue last year. SEC doesn't do shit.\n\nI could go on, but this whole thing will go like this: at some point someone will make a functional quantum computer, it's not going to be one of these companies and it's going to be 10 years in the future. \n\nThe super dumb thing about this space is that whenever one of the firms releases some positive PR, they all pump, like they are not competing with each other. Imagine AMD pumped when NVDA released a PR that they have a new breakthrough."

No real GTM message other than we do it better than Zscaler. The tech is very good but slow to actually formulate into a purchase. 18-24 month sales cycle at best and no marketing message that drives the business value of what they actually do. This is tech sale to mid-management geeks who need to convey and sell the value of the product to upper management for the sale to take place. Netskope has no universal business value message at all. Talk to a seller or engineer there and ask them to summarize what they do in a few sentences and you\u2019ll be listening to the magna carter\n\nThey would have been much more suited to be acquired by a larger org, who could integrate their SASE/SWG/CASB offering into their portfolio (ie cisco, Microsoft even CrowdStrike- the latter of the two were rumored to purchase them this time last year.)\n\nIf NTSK can go public and show even short term gains, there really is hope for any company in the cybersecurity sphere. Customers buy ZSC and PANW first and second, often times Netskope isn\u2019t even considered as customers don\u2019t think to include them."

The earnings will cover April 1st to June 30th, which was prime panic time about tariffs. \n\n\nTheir previous earnings report from May 15th led to a slight dip, and that covered January to March. They rebounded before month was over. \n\n\nMost of their press releases are after this April - June time period. So they might not do well on this earnings, but I think the July - September quarter will be much better. We will have to see how their acquisition earlier in the year has been going mostly. \n\n\nIf it becomes a falling knife, I\u2019ll add another 100 shares wherever it settles for a while. But if you are interested in a picks and shovels play for drones and other tech, give them a look and see how their earnings go. I\u2019m not expecting a surge on this one, but the next one looks more likely.\n\n\nArticles and press releases at bottom.

    "text": "US DOE launches Speed to Power initiative to meet rising demand\n*The U.S. Department of Energy has launched the Speed to Power initiative to accelerate large-scale generation and transmission projects that can support the country\u2019s rising energy needs. The DOE argues that current project development is moving too slowly to meet the demands of reindustrialization and the growing manufacturing base, as well as the surging load from artificial intelligence and data centers. By working with stakeholders, the department aims to identify projects that can deliver power reliably while addressing the challenges of today\u2019s grid.*\n\n*Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the U.S. will need much more energy in the years ahead and emphasized that, under President Trump\u2019s leadership, the DOE intends to ensure this demand can be met with affordable, reliable, and secure energy. The Speed to Power initiative is designed to harness private-sector expertise and expand the use of all viable energy sources so the United States can remain competitive in the global AI race.*\n\n*The first step is a request for information to collect input on large-scale projects, including both generation and transmission. The program builds on Trump\u2019s first-day executive order declaring a National Energy Emergency, which called for an urgent expansion of energy infrastructure to strengthen both national and economic security.*\n\n*In connection with that order, the DOE released a report on grid reliability and security that sets a standard methodology to identify regions most at risk and guide interventions. The report warns that if firm, reliable sources are not added as older capacity retires, blackouts could rise one hundredfold by 2030.*\n\n*The Speed to Power initiative is aligned with the administration\u2019s executive orders on unleashing U.S. energy and boosting American leadership in AI, directing federal resources toward removing barriers and ensuring grid infrastructure keeps pace with demand. Small modular reactors (SMRs) are viewed as an important part of this broader effort, offering new firm nuclear capacity that can be deployed more quickly and flexibly than traditional large-scale plants, helping to reinforce reliability while meeting growing power needs.*",

In May of 2025 they brought 95 gigawatts of capacity online, in 2025 the US is on track to add 63. The next one, described how tariffs are hurting manufacturing, then quickly pivoted to praise for how much added energy production they are adding...\n\nWe are so far off from competing at a global level at this point. We need to work hard at expanding nuclear capacity, but we cannot forgo production of wind and solar, we will need every drip of energy required if we are going to onshore as much manufacturing as planned.\n\nIf nuclear is going to kick off in a big way, I will need to bring at least one more person on to my staff, a very small part of our business supports the raw uranium production."

It's basically a mad rush to modernize a 70+ year old system to hold up to modern data demand. \n\nYou point about lack of knowledge, materials, and manufacturers is spot on. We are seeing a lot of schedule impacts due to a shortage of...everything. \n\nIMO a smart solution is to start moving toward a more distributed generation system so fewer transmission mega projects are needed. But you will never eliminate them entirely. Deregulation of SMR nuclear plants would be a wise step in moving the whole country forward. \n\nIn my mind this is all a practical exercise in supply v demand.

Another upside is by taking some of the overall load off the hydro plants, more water can be saved for navigation in the fall when river levels are low.\n\nPlus it doesn\u2019t eat up farmland like solar does."

Sure we call it the Windy Shitties (in the Tri-Cities WA) but the fact remains its just very inconsistent!\n\nSince you used to live here, I think you'd be shocked at all the windmills we have now.  \\~1,800 as of 2023 in WA (mostly all here on the eastside).   OR has 2,116 as of last year.  It's a lot of windmills that's for sure!\n\nThe dams can only hold back so much water and are required to always spill a certain amount for the fish, so their use as energy storage is more limited these days than in the past with maybe the exception of Grand Coulee & Banks Lake which was built specifically for that purpose.\n\nAs for solar, the Hanford site has 586 square miles so I think there is plenty of land around here suitable for that which won't be farmed!"

Most of TTD\u2019s slide this year is in reaction to the walled gardens (GOOG, AMZN, META) getting bigger because TTD doesn\u2019t have access to youtube, prime video and ig.\n\n[Shanked by Google, jumped by Amazon, and left holding META's lunch tray. ](https://preview.redd.it/j4cdi2znn4qf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a3a6bef7e1489a97126b63dca60e2c49fe2ff07)\n\nThey aren\u2019t taking this lying down, TTD bought back $647 mil between the first two quarters of 25 and have $375 mil left to use under that approval. Buybacks like this are bc the c suite is either putting their dicks on the table and saying \u201cwe\u2019re undervalued\u201d or they want to cook the books and boost eps. I don\u2019t care either way because I think they\u2019ll buoy the share price at the 52 wk low. The fed cuts also boost valuation models making future earnings look better for a growth stock like TTD. \n\nThe DOJ vs. Goog ad tech remedies case begins next week. Guilt for Goog has already been decided, this is now about how they will change their monopoly on digital advertising by controlling both the publisher and ad exchange. DOJ is pushing for a breakup of the stack, which would give TTD access to premium inventory and be a huge tailwind. Most of the c suite for TTD has testified at one point in this trial and the CEO said \u201cTTD managed to win in an unfair market, imagine what we could do in a fair market\u201d. Well I\u2019m putting my $$ on CEO Jeff Green\u2019s imaginings. \n\n[Got flamed last time for posting after my position was already up so this is hot off the press.](https://preview.redd.it/m6lu0fd3o4qf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d54a33d6a6fbefca78b474a478c3e828bb6b776)\n\nFinal considerations are for their new AI tools and the possibility of M&A. Kokai and OpenPath will be fully launched by the end of this year, these are meaningful next gen innovations. Brands using Kokai so far have seen a 43% lower cost per household reach on ads and OpenPath has led to 39% bump in CTV revenue for clients like Vizio. If the remedies case forces Goog to make major changes, the rest of big tech could say fuck it and buy TTD given the current depressed valuation, giving better reach in the open internet and picking up a competitor. Big media like Disney or Roku could also integrate or partner to control supply path and reduce dependency, like what we just saw with Amazon and Netflix. \n\nAlso incredibly small flyer chance TikTok\u2019s walled garden is opened up in the US acquisition giving TTD further opportunity.",

Meanwhile, Amazon\u2019s own DSP is eating TTD\u2019s lunch with 22% growth last quarter and Prime Video ads scaling like crazy. TTD maybe a long-term bet. But short term, it\u2019s looking like a bloodbath. Good luck to OP."
